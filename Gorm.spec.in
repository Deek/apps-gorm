%description 
Gorm is an acronym for Graphic Object Relationship modeler (or perhaps
GNUstep Object Relationship Modeler).  Gorm is a clone of the NeXTstep
`Interface Builder' application for GNUstep.  Gorm is not `gormless'
(a Yorkshire dialect word that my parents used when they spotted me
staring, slack-jawed, at the TV).
