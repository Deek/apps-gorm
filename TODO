TO DO:

This is my personal TO DO list based on feature requests that I am
hearing from users of Gorm.   Currently a number of requests are on the
table which seem intersting:

* Add support for Font Aliases so that fonts are not archived into the
  .gorm file.   This will allow the application to use the fonts as 
  defined by the user, not as archived in .gorm. (fabien)

* Set up defaults to allow Gorm to "preload" headers each time it starts
  up.   (cbv)
