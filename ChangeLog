	Gomr.m: Fixed typo in info panel and updated a little.

2001-07-04 Pierre-Yves Rivaille <pyrivail@ens-lyon.fr>

	Added the ability to create the .m and .h files of a class created
	within Gorm (it's a basic implementation but it works)

	Added an "application: openFile:" method in the class Gorm and a
	GormInfo.plist file, it is now possible to open a Gorm document from
	ProjectCenter (and I suppose GWorkspace but I have not checked yet)

	a keyEquivalent for the inspector (i was really missing this ...)

	no more [menu display] in the initialization of Gorm, I found out that
	it prevented a proper docking within WindowMaker's dock, and it does
	not seem to have any side effect.
