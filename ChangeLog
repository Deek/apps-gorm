2003-02-10  Pierre-Yves Rivaille <pyrivail@ens-lyon.fr>

	* GormInspectorsManager.m: _internalCall:

	with the new lockFocus code.

2003-02-02  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Palettes/3Containers/GormTableViewEditor.m: missing
	"else" was causing an exception to be thrown when attempting

2003-01-14  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: replaceTemplatesWithObjects: when

	* GormClassManager.m: -[GormClassManager customClassForObject:]:
	Added code to resolve the object being passed in to the name
	which is used in the name table.   This is for lookup in the
	custom class map.   This corrects a problem which was introduced
	in the previous fix.
	* GormInspectorsManager.m: in browser delegate.  Removed code
	which was looking up the name seperately.   Now relies on code
	added above.

	change any of the attributes on a GormObjectProxy.
	
2002-12-27  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: -[GormDocument parseHeader:] added code to select
	the class when it is loaded in the classes view.  Also modified the

2002-11-23  Gregory John Casamento  <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Gorm.m: -[GormClassProxy classInspectorClassName]:
	changed to return @"GormNotApplicableInspector" so that

	* GormDocument.[hm]: added -[GormDocument removeConnectionsWithLabel: 
	(NSString *)name forClassNamed: (NSString *)className
	isAction: (BOOL)action.  This method removes the connections relavent

	delegate to call it and to present the user w/ an alert panel.  This
	is consistent w/ how InterfaceBuilder behaves.
	
2002-11-20  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* GModelDecoder.m
	([GormObjectProxy -initWithModelUnarchiver:]): Retain the className.

	[GormClassManager -customClassMap]
	to NSMutableDictionary and set parameter of 
	[GormClassManager -setCustomClassMap:] to NSMutableDictionary.

	now simply assigns the class map instead of copying it.
	* GormCustomClassInspector.m: Copy the name of the class from 
	the cell using [NSString stringWithString:] instead of using 
	the value directly which might cause memory issues.  Also changed 
	code to remove the custom class mapping if if the class is 
	mapped back to the parent class name.
	* GormDocument.m: Set the version of the GormDocument class in the
	[GormDocument +initialize] method.   Removed some commented out code
	in the [GormDocument -_createSoundPlaceHolder:] method.   In
	[GormDocument -beginArchiving] and [GormDocument -endArchiving] added 
	code to avoid template replacement, if we are in testing mode.  This 
	corrected a core dump when testing w/ a .gorm that used custom 
	classes.  Moved place where the custom classes are set 
	in [GormDocument -loadDocument] which was causing a core dump.

	gorm file package when the .gorm is saved and registering them w/
	Gorm when the package is subsequently loaded.
	* GormPrivate.h: Added class declaration for GormSound, the
	sound placeholder class.  This class contains the minimal information
	needed to handle sounds in Gorm.

	to beginning of block for gcc 2.X

	* Palettes/0Menus/main.m (-finishInstantiate): Change actions
	to appropriate NSDocument methods.

	* Palettes/2Controls/inspectors.m ([NSStepper
	-sizeInspectorClassName]): Remove so normal size inspector is
	used.

2002-10-13  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Gorm.m: Implemented methods necessary to read the
	templates back from the gorm file and transform them
	back into the appropriate parent class.   Also made modifications
	to the template additions for NSWindowTemplate, and all other
	templates so that the correct init method is called.
	* GormClassManager.h: Added more methods to handle custom classes and
	cleaned up some of the references to "NSObject".  These should be
	"id" instead.
	* GormClassManager.m: Added implementations of the custom class
	methods.  Removed the old implementation for the 
	"GormClassInspector" from the source.

	methods necessary to allow the user to select a class from a list
	of classes presented in the inspector.
	* GormDocument.h: Added tempNameTable variable to hold the objects 
	while the gorm is being persisted.   This allows the templates
	to be substituted during the archiving process and the real
	objects to be saved and restored afterwards.  Added deferred windows
	variable.
	* GormDocument.m: Added -[_replaceObjectsWithTemplates] and
	-[replaceTemplatesWithObjects] which are called from -[beginArchiving]
	and -[endArchiving] respectively.  These methods substitute the
	templates into the object graph when the gorm is persisted and restore
	the original objects so that the gorm can continue to be edited after
	the save.   Also made necessary modifications to -[loadDocument] and
	-[saveDocument] to save the custom class list.   Added methods to
	allow windows to be deffered [setWindow:isDeffered] and
	-[isWindowDeferred].

	categories for the template classes.  Declared Gorm template
	classes.

	* Palettes/3Containers/main.m: The scroll view for the table view and
	outline view were not being added to the window prior to the

2002-07-22  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Resources/GormCustomClassInspector.[gorm,classes]: Added.
	* GormCustomClassInspector.[hm]: Added.	Custom class support is not 
	fully functional.   I am currently working on it, but I thought 
	it would be useful to commit the code sooner rather than later.
	* Gorm.m: Made some fixes to prevent core dump.
	* GormClassManager.m: Removed some debugging NSLog calls and
	added logic to prevent the addition of duplication outlets/actions
	to a class.
	* GormDocument.m: Finished up the delete functionality.   Added code
	to show an alert panel when the user tries to add a duplicate outlet/
	action to the class.
	* GormOutlineView.m: Added method to allow deletion of a given
	row directly from the outline view.
	* GormInspectorsManager.m: Modified to pop up button to show custom

	classes:
	
	- (NSArray*) customSubClassesOf: (NSString *)superclass;
	- (NSArray*) allCustomSubclassesOf: (NSString *)superclass;

	and also made some corrections in the replaceOutlet to correct a
	problem with editing in the classes view.
	
2002-07-16  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormObjectInspector.m: Removed extra RELEASE at line 93 which
	was causing core dump.
	* GormTableViewEditor.m: Removed [document detachObject: selected]
	since this was deleting the reference in the map to the table when 
	a column was deleted making connections impossible.

2002-07-14  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>
	
	* GormClassManager.[hm]: Added methods to support deletion of

 	- (BOOL) loadCustomClasses: (NSString*)path;
 	- (BOOL) isCustomClass: (NSString *)className;
 	- (BOOL) isAction: (NSString *)actionName 
		ofClass: (NSString *)className;
 	- (BOOL) isOutlet: (NSString *)
		outletName ofClass: (NSString *)className;	
	Changed the format of the ".classes" file to store only the 
	custom classes.  This is more efficient since the full class 
	list is already loaded when the GormClassManager is 
	initialized.  The custom class list is merged with this
	to create the display shown in the classes view.
	* GormDocument.m: modified to utilize the above routines in 
	the method which loads the .gorm file and the data source.
	* GormOutlineView.m: Added new methods to add new actions/outlets 
	with generic names so that the user can edit the actions/outlets 
	once added.
	
2002-07-13  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Gorm.m: Corrected typo in method name.   Added check to prevent

	to the data source from the outline view.  Also changed the drawing
	code so that the outlet/action being edited doesn't shift when
	clicked.

	* GormClassManager.m: Added stubs for two new method to add actions
	and outlets based on classname.

	can be used by the data source.

2002-07-09  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Gorm.m: Added new menu item and method to add outlet/action
	-[Gorm addAttributeToClass:]
	* GormDocument.m: Added new method which gets called by the one
	in Gorm.m and passes control to the classesView.
	* GormOutlineView.m added -[GormOutlineView addAttributeToClass]
	to add either an outlet or an action depending on what type 
	is currently open.  Currently it only adds the name and doesn't
	modify the datasource.  The next version will.
	
2002-07-08  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormOutlineView.m -[drawRow:] Added logic to draw inverse
	image of the outlet or action button to visually indicate which
	is being edited in the outline view.

	outlets are being edited.
	* Images/GormActionSelected.tiff: Added
	* Images/GormOutletSelected.tiff: Added
	* GNUmakefile: Modified to copy images to the resources directory.
	
2002-07-08  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormOutlineView.[hm] : Added.   This is a NSOutlineView
	subclass handles outlets and actions for the class view.  
	As of this revision, you can view the actions and outlets of
	a class, but you can't edit them.
	* GormDocument.m: Modified to use new class.
	* GormInspectorsManager.m: Removed some code which was causing
	the application to dump core on exit.

2002-05-04  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormClassEditor.m: Added blank implementation of
	[GormClassEditor -makeSelectionVisible:(BOOL)] method.   
	When creating a new class and editing it, the application was 
	throwing an exception due to the abcense of this method.  
	It now seems to function correctly.
	
2002-04-08  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Palettes/0Menus/GormNSMenu.m
	[GormNSMenu -_createWindow]: removed NSLog statement before
