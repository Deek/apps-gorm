	* Palettes/3Containers/GNUmakefile.preamble
	* Palettes/4Data/GNUmakefile.preamble: Removed extra slash for
	compilation under MinGW on win32.
	
2004-10-23 20:16 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormLib/GNUmakefile.postamble: Changed the build process a little
	to be more compatible with MinGW on win32.
	
2004-10-17 12:51 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormControlEditor.m: Added necessary methods for dragging
	of the formatter to the view.
	* GormInternalViewEditor.m: Changed initWithObject:inDocument:
	so that the view doesn't attempt to accept an IBFormatterPboardType
	object from the drag when it shouldn't.
	* GormViewEditor.m: Made similar changes here.
	* Palettes/4Data/inspectors.m: Removed hard coded implementations
	of tables.  Added code to blank inspector when the formatter is
	detached.
	* Palette/4Data/GormNSDateFormatterInspector.gorm: Updated with
	new table.
	* Palette/4Data/GormNSNumberFormatterInspector.gorm: Updated with
	new table.
	
2004-10-03 12:51 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormMatrixEditor.m: Added performDragOperation implementation
	to allow the drag and drop of sound/images to a matrix cell.
	* GormPrivate.h: Moved a category which defines a method called
	on setArchiveByName to this header so it's useful to more than
	just the editors.
	* GormViewEditor.m: Removed category declaration.
	* Palettes/2Controls/GormButtonEditor.m: Removed some old,
	commented out code.
	
2004-10-02 13:08 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Resources/GormDocument.gorm: Changed the spacing of the
	file view so that the text fields don't get cut off.
	
2004-10-02 01:15 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Palettes/0Menus/GormNSMenu.m: Modified 
	-[GormNSMenu handleNotification:] so that the menu is no longer
	closed if the window which displays it isn't visible.  This 
	prevents the annoying "Ordering invalid window 0" error.
	
2004-09-27 07:40 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormFilePrefsManager.m: Bumped version to 0.8.1 (Alpha)
	* GormInfo.plist: Bumped version to 0.8.1 (Alpha)
	* Documentation/Gorm.texi: Updated documentation.
	
2004-09-26 08:16 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>
	
	* Version 0.8.0
	
2004-09-25 07:21 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormInfo.plist: Changed version number to 0.8.0 (Alpha)
	since we are now, more or less, in "pre-release" mode.
	* GormFilePrefsManager.m: Updated call which sets version.
	* Palettes/0Menus/GormMenuAttributesInspector.gorm:
	* Palettes/1Windows/GormNSWindowInspector.gorm:
	* Palettes/2Controls/ControlsPalette.gorm:
	* Palettes/2Controls/GormNSBoxInspector.gorm:

	* Palettes/3Containers/GormTabViewInspector.gorm:
	* Palettes/4Data/GormNSComboBoxInspector.gorm:
	* Palettes/4Data/GormNSDateFormatterInspector.gorm:
	* Palettes/4Data/GormNSImageViewInspector.gorm:
	* Palettes/4Data/GormNSNumberFormatterInspector.gorm:
	* Palettes/4Data/GormNSTextViewInspector.gorm: Modified spacing
	of the widgets so that text isn't clipped when using Vera
	font.

2004-09-24  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* GModelDecoder.m ([GormDocument -openGModel:]): Initialize
	variable.

2004-09-17 18:07 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* VersionProfiles.plist: Updated the profile to properly
	set the version for NSTextFieldCell which has also been
	updated since the last release.
	
2004-09-17 00:54 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormPalettesManager.m: Added code to [GormPalettesManager
	setCurrentPalette:] to change the title to reflect the 
	name of the palette currently selected.  This makes it easier
	for the developer to navigate the palettes.
	
2004-09-17 00:54 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Palettes/2Controls/ControlsPalette.gorm: Removed old 14pt.
	system title widget and added some widgets which are standard
	sized which use the system defined fonts. 
	* Palettes/2Controls/main.m: Changed the location of the
	pulldown, since it isn't in the .gorm.
	
2004-09-12 20:06 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Gorm.m: Made some changes in [Gorm testInterface] and
	[Gorm endTesting] to change the icon when testing and also
	to modify the menu and quit titles so that it is obvious to
	the user that Gorm is in testing mode and has not died.
	* Images/GormTesting.tiff: Alternate icon used when Gorm
	is testing.

2004-09-08 22:00 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Gorm.m: Removed main function from Gorm class file.
	* main.m: Added main function here.
	
2004-09-07 21:00 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Gorm.m: Removed some old code which measured the startup
	time for the application.
	* GormDocument.m: Removed previous temporary fix.
	* Palettes/3Containers/GormTableViewEditor.m: Correction for
	recently discovered crash.   The problem is located here.   
	I have added a retain which seems to stop the crash, but 
	I need to find a better solution.   Also removed some old 
	commented out code.
	* Palettes/3Containers/inspectors.m: Properly indented some
	code.
	
2004-09-06 17:39 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Gorm.m:
	* GormInspectorsManager.m:
	* GormInternalViewEditor.m:
	* GormMatrixEditor.m:
	* GormViewKnobs.m:
	* GormWindowEditor.m: Removed some old FIXME comments which
	were no longer appropriate or which have already been 
	addressed.
	
2004-09-06 15:30 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: Temporary fix for crash.   Corrects a 
	problem with document deallocation, until I can find a more
	permanent solution.

2004-09-06 08:52 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* ClassInformation.plist: Added missing NSImageCell class
	description.
	* Palettes/3Containers/inspectors.m: Corrected issue with
	getting the class name of the data cell in
	[GormTableColumnAttributesInspector _getCellClassName].
	
2004-09-06 08:38 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* ClassInformation.plist: Reformatted to canonical plist.
	Suggested by Deek/Jeff.
	* Palettes/3Containers/GormNSTableColumnInspector.gorm: 
	Added title and made the table draw the grid.
	
2004-09-05 12:17 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Palettes/3Containers/inspectors.m: Added _getCellClassName 
	to GormTableColumnAttribitesInspector to get the cell class
	for the inspector.  Also modified _getValuesFromObject: to
	call the method and display the cell class name in the table.
	Modified setValuesFromControl to add the object to the 
	document and assign the correct custom class.
	
2004-09-05 10:15 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Palettes/3Containers/GormNSTableColumnInspector.gorm: 
	Made changes to allow user to edit the tableColumn dataCell.
	* Palettes/3Containers/inspectors.m: Added code 
	for the delegate and datasource of the table added to the
	inspector.   Also modified methods _getValuesFromObject and
	_setValuesFromControl: in GormTableColumnInspector to 
	accommodate changing the dataCell and redisplaying the 
	tableView which the column belongs to.
	
2004-08-28 16:43 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormCustomView.m: Modified _bestPossibleSuperClass to 
	return NSView if the class isn't defined or is not an
	NSView subclass.
	
2004-08-28 11:00 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Gorm.m: Added calls to [GSClassSwapper 
	setIsInInterfaceBuilder:] to shut off the custom class -> real
	class morphing when testing.  Added implementation for
	method which changes the static value of the flag as well
	called setIsInInterfaceBuilder:.
	* GormDocument.m: Added calls in loadDocument: to
	[GSClassSwapper setIsInInterfaceBuilder:] to turn off custom
	class conversion while loading the .gorm document.
	* GormCustomView.m: Added implementation of a method 
	called _bestPossibleSuperClass to get the best substitute
	for the custom class specified when testing the interface.
	This allows the user to see a more accurate picture
	of what the gui will look like when it's done.
	
2004-08-25 22:28 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Palettes/1Windows/GormNSWindow.m: Removed canBecomeKeyWindow
	method.  This was returning NO and preventing the method user
	from setting the font.
	
2004-08-23 22:28 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormClassInspector.m: Corrected bug introduced a few 
	days ago.  The actions tag in the class inspector wasn't 
	functioning correctly.
	
2004-08-23 15:06 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Palettes/1Windows/GormNSPanel.[hm]:
	* Palettes/1Windows/GormNSWindow.[hm]: Changed the name
	of the styleMask method to _styleMask.  Since this serves
	as a "proxy" of the original value so that it can be edited
	without effecting the window, it shouldn't have the same
	name as the method in the parent class anyway.  The new 
	window decoration code was calling this method. 
	* Palettes/1Windows/main.m: [GormWindowAttributesInspector
	_setValuesFromControl:] and [GormWindowAttributesInspector
	_getValuesFromObject] changed to use new method name.
	
2004-08-21 00:20 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Palettes/1Windows/GormNSPanel.m:
	* Palettes/1Windows/GormNSWindow.m: Added code to prevent
	redundant release and subsequent crash.
	
2004-08-18 00:20 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormClassEditor.m: Cleaned up some code.
	* GormClassInspector.m: Added code in the data source for
	both the GormActionDataSource and GormOutletDataSource 
	classes in the class inspector to call the method in 
	GormDocument which removes connections when a connections'
	name changes.  Corrects Bug #100026.
	* GormMenuEditor.m: If a menu item being added to a popup
	has a submenu, reject it.
	
2004-08-13 18:30 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Gorm.m: Disabled class parser menu item in [Gorm
	validateMenuItem:].
	* GormClassManager.m: [GormClassManager parseClass:]
	commented out contents of this method.   The class
	parser needs to be replaced and it shouldn't be
	used until it's rewritten.
	
2004-08-12 21:41 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Gorm.m: [Gorm validateMenuItem:] deselect the cut, delete,
	paste, etc. items for top level objects which cannot be
	removed.
	* GormDocument.m: Simplified implementation of
	[GormDocument isTopLevelObject:] to simply check in the
	set of top level objects.
	
2004-08-11 22:41 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.[hm]: Added back isTopLevelObject:.
	
2004-08-11 07:18 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: Removed the delegate and data source
	for the outline view.   Changed the code in init to use 
	the GormClassEditor as the outline view, instead of
	instantiating two different classes.   I also changed
	the coded in other areas where "classEditor" was being
	used.  Removed an uneeded method.
	* GormClassEditor.m: Added the delegate here.   Added the
	initialization code from GormDocument init to the init 
	method here.
	* GormPrivate.h: Made GormClassEditor into a subclass
	of GormOutlineView.  This ultimately makes the code 
	cleaner as it unifies the view/editor for the class
	editor.
	
2004-08-09 17:18 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormFilePrefsManager.m: The method showIncompatibilities:
	added call to "center" method on iwindow so that the 
	incompatibilities window shows up in the center of the
	screen.
	
2004-08-08 16:46 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Resource/GormDocument.gorm: Made text label lengths a
	little longer.

2004-08-08 16:33 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Palettes/0Menus/GormNSMenu.m: Changed the code in 
	handleNotification to not call edited object blindly.
	It now checks to make sure the object responds to the 
	message before calling.
	
2004-08-08 13:43 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Palettes/1Windows/GormNSWindow.m: Removed some debugging
	information.
	
2004-08-08 13:23 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.[hm]: Added ivar isDocumentOpened
	to track when document is opened and closed.   
	The document was being made active while closing and was 
	causing an issue with some of the windows in the document 
	being edited being brought to the front even though the 
	document itself had been deallocated.  This is the
	permanent fix for the previously discovered issue.
	* Palettes/1Windows/GormNSWindow.m: Added canBecomeKeyWindow
	which returns NO.  The edited window should never be able
	to become either key or main window within the application.

2004-08-07 06:10 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormObjectEditor.m: Temporary fix for recently discovered
	crash.
	
2004-08-06 07:20 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Palettes/GormMenuEditor.m: Added rightMouseDown: method
	to effectively ignore when the right mouse button is 
	pressed when over a menu that is being edited.  This was
	causing the problem described in Bug#9827.
	
2004-08-05 01:36 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Palettes/GormNSMenu.m: Added code in the initWithCoder:
	method to subscribe to the notification which indicates
	a selection change.  When the notification is recieved,
	if the menu is owned by a popup the menu is closed.  This
	corrects Bug#9771.
	
2004-08-04 01:08 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormPalettesManager.m: -[GormPalettesManager loadPalette:]
	added code to made sure that the palette view cannot exceed
	the maximum size.  This prevents accidentally causing the 
	issue cited in the previous entry.
	
2004-08-04 00:52 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: -[GormDocument setupDefaults:] changed
	size of the window for a new palette.  If it's too big it 
	causes problems with event handling in the palettes.
	* Palettes/2Controls/GNUmakefile: Added ControlsPalette.gorm
	* Palettes/2Controls/main.m: Removed much of the code
	from the ControlsPalette class.  It's not needed now
	that the palette uses a .gorm file.
	* Palettes/2Controls/ControlsPalette.gorm: New gui for the
	palette.
	
2004-08-02 23:00 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormViewEditor.m: Added stub for initWithCoder just for
	completeness.
	* Palettes/2Controls/GormButtonEditor.m: Change references
	to xDist and yDist to new names from NSCell.h
	
2004-08-02 08:54 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormPalettesManager.m: Clarified error message when
	unable to load palettes.
	
2004-08-02 00:54 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormPrefController.m: Center the window the prefs appear
	in.  Changed [GormPrefController awakeFromNib] to center 
	the window.
	
2004-08-02 00:14 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Palettes/2Controls/inspectors.m: Reversion of previous
	change.   The real problem was that in setObject: the 
	_setValuesFromObject: method was being called unnecessarily.
	The call has been removed.
	
2004-08-01 23:17 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormLib/IBEditors.m: Removed some old comments which are
	no longer pertinent.   Added documentation for all methods.
	* GormLib/IBObjectAdditions.m: Added documentation for all
	methods.
	* GormLib/IBPalette.h: Clarified documentation of one of
	the methods.
	* Palettes/0Menus/GormNSMenu.m: Removed some old commented
	out code.  Changed superclass of GormNSMenuWindow to NSPanel.
	* Palettes/2Controls/inspectors.m: Made the first two lines
	conditional for NSForm and subclasses.  These were causing
	a bug which was making it difficult to edit button matrices
	since the title would revert when clicking on on the next
	button.  This corrects issue #9830.

2004-07-27 02:15 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormLib/IBInspector.m: Change the name of the method called
	when receiving IBDocumentWillCloseNotification to _releaseObject:
	instead of handleNotification:.  This prevents confusion as some
	of the subclasses define handleNotification for other
	purposes.
	* GormDocument.m: Modified the code in instantiateObject so that
	NSView itself can be instantiated.


2004-07-27 02:15 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Gorm.m: Cleaned up some commented out code.
	* GormDocument.m: Added code in [GormDocument instantiateClass] 
	to add the appropriate information to the document when an
	NSView subclass is instantiated in the classes view.  
	This is for "standalone view" support.  Some additional cleanup.
	* GormGenericEditor.m: The editor wasn't calling 
	[GormDocument editor:didCloseForObject:] as it should when the
	editor is closed. Added implementation for isOpened to give
	any subeditors the correct response when the editor is opened.
	* GormInternalViewEditor.m: Added code to show the appropriate
	image when we have a standalone view in the document.
	* GormPrivate.h: Added declaration for isOpened to 
	GormGenericEditor class declaration.
	* GormViewEditor.h: Added ivar for GormViewWindow.
	* GormViewEditor.m: Added code in activate, deactivate, and
	resetObject to properly show the standalone view.  This allows
	the user to see and edit the view.
	* GormViewWindow.[hm]: completed implementation of this class
	for use by the GormViewEditor.  
	* GormLib/IBEditors.h: Properly documented resetObject.
	* GormLib/IBInspector.m: Added code which releases objects held
	by the inspector after the document has been released.  This
	prevents problems with old objects being retained in memory
	by the inspectors until another object is selected.
	* Palettes/0Menu/GormNSMenu.m: corrected a crash caused by a
	recent change.
	* Palettes/3Containers/GormNSOutlineView.m: Added
	allocSubstitute method.
	* Palettes/3Containers/GormNSTableView.m: Added
	allocSubstitute method.
	
2004-07-20 20:04 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>
	
	* GormDocument.m: Leak fixes and general clean up.
	* GormGenericEditor.m: Same.
	* GormImageEditor.m: Same.
	* GormViewEditor.h: Same.
	* GormWindowEditor.m: Same.
	* Palettes/0Menus/GormMenuEditor.m: Same.
	* Palettes/0Menus/GormNSMenu.m: Same.
	* Palettes/1Windows/GormNSPanel.h: Added new method so that the
	window setting "is released when closed" is saved, but doesn't
	effect the window displayed in Gorm.  This presents some tricky
	memory management problems.
	* Palettes/1Windows/GormNSPanel.m: Same.
	* Palettes/1Windows/GormNSWindow.h: Same.
	* Palettes/1Windows/GormNSWindow.m: Same.
	* Palettes/1Windows/main.m: Added code necessary in the 
	inspector to use the new method.

2004-07-17 17:54 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormFilePrefsManager.m: Removed reference to math.h and values.h
	in includes.   They were there temporarily for something which I
	ended up not doing anyway.   Causing compilation problem on FreeBSD.

2004-07-15 21:43 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Gorm.m: Added a check in applicationDidFinishLaunching:
	to make certain the user is using the right version of GNUstep
	by checking for a recent signature change in GSNibContainer.
	* ClassInformation.plist: Added redo: and undo: to the list of
	methods on the first responder.
	* GormFilePrefsManager.m: Changed a lot of the NSLogs to 
	NSDebugLog.
	
2004-07-12 23:08 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormImageEditor.m: [GormImageEditor initWithObject:inDocument:]
	added call to [GormPalettesManager importedImages] to return
	the images imported by any custom palettes.
	* GormSoundEditor.m: [GormSoundEditor initWithObject:inDocument:]
	added call to [GormPalettesManager importedSounds] to return
	the sounds imported by any custom palettes.
	* GormPalettesManager.m: Changed the return of 
	[GormPalettesManager importClasses:withDictionary:], added
	[GormPalettesManager importImages:withBundle:],
	[GormPalettesManager importSounds:withBundle:],
	[GormPalettesManager importedImages], and
	[GormPalettesManager importedImages].  These methods are
	used to get the images and sounds from a palette so that
	they can be used from Gorm by the user.
	* GormPalettesManager.h: Added banner.
	
	
2004-07-11 23:40 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: saveGormDocument.m: Changes to prevent a
	new gorm from being saved twice.  This was an innocuous problem
	as it would simply overwrite the same .gorm with itself.
	Added code to set isOlderArchive in loadDocument: method.
	Added code to call [GormFilePrefsManager setClassVersions] and 
	[GormFilePrefsManager restoreClassVersions] in beginArchiving and 
	endArchiving respectively to set and reset the versions of classes
	which need to be used for each .gorm file version to be saved.
	Updated changeView: method to switch to the filePrefsView when clicking
	on the button.
	Added code to the toolbar delegate to add the "File" button to the 
	document toolbar.
	Added code to loadDocument to load the data.info file if it's 
	present, if not
	we simply use the defaults.
	* GormDocument.h: Added new ivars for isOlderArchive, filePrefsView,
	and filePrefsManager.
	* GormFilePrefsManager.[hm]: New files.
	* GormPalettesPref.[hm]: New files.
	* GormPrefsPalette.gorm: new interface for palette loading.
	* GormDocument.gorm: Updated with new window to view 
	incompatibilities and controller for new "file" document
	button.
	* GormPreferences.gorm: Addition of palettes in pulldown.
	* GormClassManager.[hm]: Added 
	- (BOOL) addClassNamed: (NSString*)class_name
	     withSuperClassNamed: (NSString*)super_class_name
	        withActions: (NSArray*)_actions
		withOutlets: (NSArray*)_outlets
		isCustom: (BOOL) isCustom;
	So that classes can be added with out adding them to the custom
	list.
	Added logic in "init" to get the list of classes imported by
	the palettes manager and add them into the master list of classes.
	This allows the user to work with the classes added by the palette.
	* GormFunctions.[hm]: appVersion function to calculate a useful value
	which can be used to compare against easily when reading.  This will
	allow gorm to tell if this file was created with an older or newer
	version of Gorm.app and take appropriate action.
	* GormObjectEditor.m: Added capability to place non-UI instances in the
	objects view directly.  This will allow the user to place arbitrary
	non-ui objects in a Gorm file.  It will be useful for adding DB objects
	or other things which a .gorm file might need.
	* GormPalettesManager.[hm]: Added [GormPalettesManager importedClasses]
	and [GormPalettesManager importClasses:withDictionary:] adds the 
	classes from the list in the palette.table.
	* GormLib/IBPalette.h: Changed name of ivar.  This ivar wasn't properly
	named.  It should have been originalWindow.  This issue was causing the
	.gorm load to not make a needed connection.
	* GormLib/IBPalette.m: Change to read palette.table as a property list
	instead of strings file format.  This was needed to facilitate the
	reading of all of the classes, sounds and images a palette might
	import.  Also modified to correctly load the nib file.
	* Palettes/0Menus/main.m: Corrected window to originalWindow as 
	detailed above.  It was referred to in a few places by the old name.
	* Palettes/1Windows/main.m: same.
	* Palettes/2Controls/main.m: same.
	* Palettes/3Containers/main.m: same.
	* Palettes/4Data/main.m: same.
	* Palettes/2Controls/inspectors.m: Change to clarify the autoenable 
	switch on pulldown buttons.
	* Palettes/2Controls/GormNSPopUpButtonInspector.gorm: Corresponding 
	.gorm file change for the above.  Added new outlet and made new 
	connection.
	
2004-07-09 16:24 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Palettes/3Containers/GormNSTableViewInspector.gorm: Missing
	connection to ok: from the tag form was causing the table
	not to save the value.
	
2004-06-30 20:14 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: Added "Compatibility Warning" alert panel
	to [GormDocument saveGormDocument:].  If the user loads a
	version 0 file and saves it will give a warning telling the
	user that the new version isn't compatible with older
	releases of GNUstep.
	* GormDocument.h: Added ivar to keep track of whether we
	are going to upgrade the version of the .gorm file or not.
	
2004-06-30 01:45 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: [GormDocument loadDocument:] the application
	was not picking up subclasses of GSNibItem (GormObjectProxy) 
	properly from version 0 files.  I needed to add a loop which
	iterates through the objects, since the GormObjectProxy doesn't
	call the super class's initWithCoder: method.

2004-06-28 23:14 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Gorm.m: -[Gorm testInterface:] changed awakeWithContext: call
	to use new signature.
	* GormDocument.m: [GormDocument rebuildObjToNameMapping] 
	added logic to add all of the objects in the topLevelObjects
	set to the objects view.  Modified 
	[GormDocument attachObject:toParent:] so that any top level
	object which is attached, such as a window, the main, menu,
	or a controller is automatically added to the topLevelObjects
	set.  Modified [GormDocument loadDocument:] so that the
	topLevelObjects set is properly merged into the current 
	document's data structures.  [GormDocument setupDefaults:]
	removed explicit call to [GormDocument setName:forObject:]
	since the attachObject:toParent: method automatically makes
	the new menu in a .gorm which doesn't have any menus the
	main menu and adds it to the topLevelItems array.
	* GormPalettesManager.m: Removed some of the palette prefs
	code for now so I could concentrate on the version update.
	* GormSoundView.m: Commented out currently unused function.
	* Resources/Gorm.gorm: Updated to a version 1 gorm file.
	This prevent someone from running the new Gorm with the old
	gnustep which doesn't contain the recent changes.  
	
2004-06-27 08:45 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Gorm.m: -[Gorm testInterface:] removed NSWindowsMenu and
	NSServicesMenu from the nameTable of the .gorm being tested.
	This prevents an exception because of problems re-setting
	these on the fly.
	* GormPalettesManager.m: The beginnings of getting the 
	palettes from a default rather than being hardcoded.  This
	allows greater flexibility in adding custom palettes to 
	Gorm later on.

2004-06-26 18:10 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormPalettesManager.m: Removed line in -init which observes 
	IBDidDeleteConnectionNotification in GormConnectionInspector.
	It was causing a number of bugs since it could potentially modify 
	the connection prior to adding it to the connections list.  Added
	method _selectAction: which is used to select the action without
	going through all of the other code in _internalCall:.
	* GormDocument.m: Added code in NSNibConnector category to let
	isEqual immediately return true if the object and self are precisely
	the same object.
	* GormClassInspector.m: Added code to change the color
	of the textfield to grey if the class isn't editable and to white
	if the class name is editable.
	
2004-06-26 08:25 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormPalettesManager.m: There was problem which crops up when the
	user has many connections to the same object both action/outlet
	in the same list.  When disconnecting it the inspector,
	because of a memory leak, was deleting the outlet & the 
	action following it.   This was happening inconsistently and
	would cause a blank line to appear in the connections inspector
	when the user would click on the object.  This was reported as
	Bug #9461.
	
2004-06-25 01:33 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: [GormDocument(GormOutlineDataSource)
	outlineView:setObjectValue:forTableColumn:byItem:] added
	code to ignore the value which comes if it is nil.  This 
	corrects a recent problem caused by a "fix" in gui's
	NSTableView.
	* GormClassInspector.m: Changes to allow the user to change
	the class name when it's a custom class that's being edited.
	* GormClassInspector.gorm: Changes to facilitate the above
	modification.
	
2004-06-24 01:33 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Gorm.m: [Gorm close:] the window is already released when
	the document is released and the code had an  
	"setReleasedWhenClosed" which was call which was causing
	an extra release and subsequently a core dump when selecting
	the "Close" item from the document menu.
	
2004-06-24 01:33 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: Additions to [GormDocument attachObject:
	withParent:], [GormDocument loadDocument:], [GormDocument
	setupDefaults:] to move the main menu appropriately when
	it is either added to the documnent, loaded, or added when
	the user selects the "Application" type from the New menu.
	This helps alleviate confusion when editing the menu.
	
2004-06-22 23:33 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: A fix in  -[GormDocument pasteType:
        fromPasteboard: parent:] to retain objects unarchived
	from the pasteboard to prevent a recently discovered 
	segfault.

2004-06-21 23:33 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GModelDecoder.m: Added code to openGModel: to more automatically
	detect what actions should be added to FirstResponder.  This 
	facilitates importing the .gmodel without even needing the
	header file.  All of the information necessary to convert the 
	interface can be gleaned from the .gmodel information.
	
2004-06-18 23:40 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Version 0.7.7
	
2004-06-15 01:28 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormPalettesManager.m: [GormPalettesManager mouseDown:] a
	call to convertRect:toView: was added to correctly translate the
	view being dragged in all cases.   This will show no real benefit
	until Alex M. adds the window decoration patches.
	
2004-06-10 01:28 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Gorm.m: [Gorm testInterface] added code in the exception
	handler to show an alert panel when an exception occurs along
	with a warning (and the actual exception, of course).  This
	allows users to see what the issue was when trying to test
	the interface.
	
2004-06-07 23:59 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormInspectorsManager.m: [GormConnectionInspector setObject:]
	corrected code to call "isConnecting" before blindly causing the
	inspector to show the connection on the selected object.  This
	was interfering with the user making connections in some cases.
	
2004-06-06 21:57 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Palettes/3Containers/GormNSOutlineView.h: added ivar
	_savedColor.  This is used to save the color during selection.
	* Palettes/3Containers/GormNSTableView.h: same as above.
	* Palettes/3Containers/GormNSTableView.m: implemented select
	and unselect methods to allow the color to be saved when the object
	is selected.
	* Palettes/3Containers/GormNSOutlineView.m: same as above.
	
2004-06-06 08:39 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormImageEditor.m: Corrected comments.
	
2004-06-04 23:53 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormImageEditor.m: Added some code to correct a problem found
	by Riccardo Mattolla and Sungjin Chun.   The code is as suggested
	by Sujin, to return when the superview is not available.
	* GormSoundEditor.m: same as above.
	NOTE: This was due to a recent change to load all images for
	easy access by the user.  Apparently, Linux is a little more
	forgiving that some other OSes. :)
	
2004-06-03 00:43 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.h: Added "lastEditor" ivar to hold the last editor
	selected by the document.
	* GormDocument.m: In [GormDocument setDocumentActive:] used 
	lastEditor to reset the selection to the current one for the document
	selected.  This causes the inspector to switch to the appropriate
	inspector for the object currently being edited in that document.
	
2004-06-03 00:43 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Gorm.m: Removed code in the testInterface: method to allow
	NSBrowser, NSTableView, and NSOutlineView display correctly in 
	testing mode.
	* GormDocument.m: Moved the code in loadDocument: into a NS_DURING
	block to catch any exceptions thrown during loading of a .gorm file.
	This will facilitate recovery of the application when a problem is 
	encountered while loading the file and will allow the user to continue 
	using the application despite the issue.
	
2004-05-30 22:37 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: [GormFirstResponder connectInspectorClassName] 
	made it return the "not applicable" inspector instead of the
	connections inspector for this.  The FirstResponder shouldn't be
	able to make outlet connections.
	
2004-05-29 23:10 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormInspectorsManager.m: [GormConnectionsInspector _internalCall:]
	The search for an existing control connection was leaving the
	con variable set to a outlet connection (occasionally) which caused
	later logic to not properly set the action list and prevented the user
	from selecting an action.
	
2004-05-29 23:10 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>	

	* Gorm.m: [Gorm testInterface:] removed conditional.  The services
	menu is always set to nil when testing. [Gorm endTesting:] added
	a NS_DURING block to catch any issues with resetting the services menu.
	This prevents Gorm from crashing, if there's a problem.  Since the 
	menu is set to nil and then reset there shouldn't be an issue.
	
2004-05-29 16:00 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: [GormDocument attachObject:] added code
	to automatically mark a menu being attached as the 
	windows/services menu if it has the appropriate title.
	Also changed [GormDocument detachObject:] added code to
	remove the menu as the services/windows menu if it's detached
	from the document.
	
2004-05-29 08:56 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>
	
	* Palettes/2Controls/main.m: Had some DOS formatted lines.   Simply
	converted to UNIX format.
	* Palettes/3Containers/main.m: Changed the default border type
	for both NSTableView and NSOutlineView to NSBezelBorder in 
	-finishInstantiate.
	* Palettes/4Data/main.m: Changed the default border type for the
	NSTextView to NSBezelBorder in -finishInstantiate.
	
2004-05-29 07:30 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Palettes/4Data/GormNSComboBoxInspector.gorm: Improved the layout
	a little.
	
2004-05-28 21:48 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormClassManager.m: Corrected a problem the the renameClassNamed:
	newName: method.   It was releasing the classInformation and causing 
	a crash.
	
2004-05-25 07:01 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Gorm.m: [Gorm testInterface:] added code to save the services
	menu and set the current one to nil, if one is not defined in the
	.gorm file.  This prevents the annoying "Services Menu not in main
	menu" warning.
	* GormPrivate.h: Added servicesMenu ivar.
	
2004-05-24 10:22 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: [GormDocument awakeFromNib] added call
	to [NSToolbar setUsesStandardBackgroundColor:] to make the 
	background light-grey instead of clear.
	
2004-05-22 12:31 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Gorm.m: [Gorm validateMenuItem:] removed code which greys
	out the add/remove for first responder.  This was preventing
	people from adding in the classes view.
	
2004-05-21 07:20 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Gorm.m: Removed the infoPanel method.
	* GormInfo.plist: Added all of the information to this file to 
	produce an identical info panel as before.
	* Gorm.gorm: Changed info menu so that "orderFrontStandardInfoPanel:"
	is called.
	
2004-05-19 07:20 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.gorm: Added.  This replaces much of the code which
	was once in [GormDocument init].
	* Gorm.m: Missing definition for GormLinkPboardType added.
	* GormDocument.h: Removed selectionView, added toolbar.
	* GormDocument.m: Added include for NSNibLoading and NSToolbar
	and removed some of the old rect declarations for creating the GUI.
	Portions of this will stay hard-coded, since the editors
	all need to be initialized with the document.   Moved some
	of the initialization around.   Added awakeFromNib method to
	load the toolbar and the toolbar delegate methods.
	
2004-05-18 07:20 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GModelDecoder.m: Changed reference to the class loader.
	* Gorm.m: Added code to inactivate menu items when a
	class isn't selected.   Moved some code to decide what is
	instantiable to the GormClassManager.
	* GormDocument.m: Moved the parseHeader: method to 
	GormClassManager where it belongs.  All methods dealing with
	loading classes into Gorm or creating class files from data within
	the application belong in GormClassManager.  Changed references
	to the call where appropriate in the code.   Added document as
	observer when a class is added.  This is to help factilitate the
	move of the parseHeader method.   Moved the init method near the top
	of the file. 
	* GormClassManager.m: added parseHeader method to process headers
	into data usable by Gorm.  Added an instance variable to cache the
	document when a class manager is instantiated.   The class manager
	needs to communicate with the document it belongs to frequently.
	* GormSoundInspector.m: Backed out previous change.
	* GormSoundInspector.h: Removed _currentSound ivar.
	
2004-05-16 07:20 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Gorm.m: in testInterface: bring the temporary menu to the 
	front.   There has been an issue with it sometimes not 
	displaying.   In endTesting bring the normal menu to the front.
	In unhide, bring the menu to the front.
	* GormLib/IBPalette.[hm]: Added paletteDocument method as 
	per specs.  Currently this method will return nil unless 
	the ivar is set to something conforming to IBDocuments.
	
2004-05-16 07:20 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormSoundEditor.m: Added methods to GormSound class to 
	show the "not applicable" inspector on all options but the
	attributes inspector.
	* GormImageEditor.m: same as above for GormImage.
	* GormInspectorsManager.m: Added code to show "Sound Inspector"
	or "Image Inspector" when appropriate for either GormSound or
	GormImage respectively.
	
2004-05-15 23:14 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormImageInspector.gorm: Repositioned fields.
	
2004-05-15 16:19 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: [GormDocument init] changed initialization
	of scrollviews to allow horizontal scroller to be used.
	* GormImageInspector.gorm: resized some of the fields which
	were too short.
	
2004-05-15 12:42 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormFunctions.[hm]: added function to get all system sounds.
	NOTE: Current there aren't any, but why wait?  I'm assuming
	that they'll go into $GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT/Library/Sounds.
	* GormSoundEditor.m: Added call to add all system sounds
	to the editor.
	
2004-05-15 11:14 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Gorm.m: Add call to [GormDocument closeAllEditors] to 
	avoid a crash when the user attempts to open a document, then
	cancels.   The document wasn't properly released.
	* GormDocument.h: Removed the images and sounds arrays.  This
	information is kept in the editor and these arrays are redundant.
	Also exposed the closeAllEditors method.
	* GormDocument.m: Removed references to the images and sounds
	array.  Changed load/save logic to use the list from the editors
	themselves.
	* GormFunctions.[hm]: Added function to retrieve the names of the
	images from the system directory named systemImagesList().
	* GormImageEditor.m: Modified to call the new function and add the
	images to the editor when it is first instantiated.
	* GormPrivate.h: Added objects method to GormGenericEditor's interface.
	* GormSoundInspector.h: Changed _currentSound to id.
	* GormSoundInspector.m: Uses _currentSound to make certain that the
	same GormSound object isn't reinspected, thus wasting time loading
	it over and over.
	
2004-05-14 22:11 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: [GormDocument _closeAllEditors] 
	mocified to use secondary array.  The close method 
	causes the editor to call editor:didCloseForObject: which
	modifies the openEditors array while the "close" message
	is being sent to all of the objects.  To avoid any issues
	with the array potentially being changed while this is happening
	I add all of the objects to another array execute the method
	on all objects of that and empty both the original and the copy.
	* GormSoundInspector.m: Corrected an issue where the sound
	wasn't immediately being set into the inspector.
	
2004-05-14 17:46 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormButtonEditor.[hm]: Moved to the Controls palette, removed from
	the main directory.   In general, inspectors and editors should
	appear in the palette which provides those things.
	* GormTabViewEditor.[hm]: Moved to Containers palette.
	
2004-05-14 11:36 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormButtonEditor.m: Added a line between some methods to 
	improve readability.
	* GormDocument.m: [GormDocument instantiateClass:] removed
	extra release for an object being added to the objectsView
	which is already autoreleased (in setName:forObject:).
	* GormInspectorsManager.m: [GormNotApplicableInspector setObject:] 
	method removed.  This was a temporary hack until the memory leak
	was located.
	
2004-05-14 02:39 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormClassManager.m: Moved the call to _touch to the bottom of
	all of the methods.   This should be called only after all changes
	have been made to the class.
	* GormImageInspector.m: setObject: wasn't calling [super setObject:]
	* GormInspectorsManager.m: [GormNotApplicableInspector setObject:]
	added code to prevent crash.
	* GormObjectEditor.m: Removed some commented-out code.
	* GormSoundInspector.m: Added code to set the _currentSound to nil if
	the selection sent is empty.
	* GormPreferences.gorm: Added line.
	
2004-05-13 18:47 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Gorm.m: Removed some commented out code.  Removed commented out
	RELEASE statements, now that AUTORELEASE is used.
	* GormDocument.m: [GormDocument dealloc] added openEditors to the
	set of things released.  [GormDocument editorForObject:create:] when
	a new editor is created, add it to the master list of editors.   This
	makes it easier to send the close message to all of the editors upon
	shutdown.  [GormDocument editor:dicCloseForObject:] removes the editor
	from the list of editors. [GormDocument _closeAllEditors] closes all
	of the editors in the document using the new list.
	* GormDocument.h: Added member variable openEditors.
	* Palettes/GormMenuEditor.m: Added category to allow testing when
	a menu is visible so that we can avoid sending the close message to
	it.  This prevents the harmless message "Invalidparm: ordered invalid 
	window 0" from appearing when the document is being closed.
	
2004-05-13 01:03 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	NOTE: These changes might unstabilize things a bit.
	* Gorm.m: The document is now autoreleased when it is instantiated.
	This change was made in [Gorm application:openFile:],[Gorm open:], 
	[Gorm newGormDocument:].
	* GormDocument.m: Addition of a method called 
	[GormDocument _closeAllEditors] this closes all of the editors from
	the handleNotification method before the any objects are ultimately
	released.  Removal of old, commented out GormFontManager 
	implementation. Streamlined the dealloc method to make certain 
	everything is released.  Also changed the window in the init 
	method so that it doesn't release itself when it's closed by 
	the user. This allows for a more controlled shutdown.
	* GormDocument.h: Minor code cleanup.
	* GormGenericEditor.[hm]: Added activate, closed ivars.  Also added 
	code in close and activate to make use of them. Added code in 
	dealloc to call [GormGenericEditor close] if there the flag 
	indicates the editor is open.  Also moved some common, trivial, 
	operations to the parent class implementation of 
	initWithObject:inDocument:.
	* GormObjectEditor.m: Added code in close to remove the document 
	from the map.  This eliminates a crash which was occurring.  
	* GormSoundEditor.m: Same.
	* GormImageEditor.m: Same.
	* GormViewEditor.m: Re-arranged the initWithObject:inDocument:.
	* GormWindowEditor.m: Same.
	* GormMenuEditor.m: Same.
	
2004-05-10 21:45 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: [GormDocument handleNotification:] was failing
	to remove the document as an observer in the notification center.
	This was causing the old document to be retained and was, also causing
	"Test Interface" to fail randomly because the notifcation cetner
	was still attempting to reach the old document.
	
2004-05-10 11:58 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Gorm.m: Update version to 0.7.7 (Alpha) to avoid confusion between
	users using the release and users using CVS.
	
2004-05-10 09:55 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Version 0.7.6
	
2004-05-10 09:08 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: Corrected an issue when creating an
	"Inspector" or "Palette" in [GormDocument setupDefaults:].
	The method was creating an NSWindow which doesn't respond
	to one of the methods the inspector needs it to.
	* GormSetName.gorm: Reduced the line to 2 pixels high to make it
	look a little better. 

2004-05-09 10:16 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GModelDecoder.m: defineClass:inFile: changed signature
	to take the object and get the classname from it.  This allows
	a call to add the class under an assumed superclass, if the user
	says no to the query.  Also in loadGModel: added code to pull
	the outlet/action from the connections and add them to the class
	if they are not present on the imported header.  This also allows,
	in the above case, for Gorm to automatically get all outlets/actions
	from the gmodel.

2004-05-08 08:53 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: [GormDocument loadDocument:] added code
	to prevent users from invoking "open objects.gorm" or opening
	"objects.gorm" directly when in GWorkspace.  This caused Gorm
	to convert the objects.gorm file as if it were an old-style file
	before gorm packages.  It now issues a warning.  Also added code
	to [GormDocument openDocument:] to check for a duplicate open 
	of a model which is already opened.  This can cause confusion.
	* Gorm.m: Added a new method [Gorm documentNameIsUnique:] which
	checks all existing open documents for a duplicate name and
	returns NO, if it's not unique.
	* GormPrivate.h: Added declaration of the method mentioned above
	to the Gorm class interface.
	
2004-05-08 08:53 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GModelDecoder.m: [GModelDecoder openGModel:] 
	Corrected issue which was causing a crash.
	* GormDocument.m: Cleaned up a memory leak.  Commented/Documented
	the location / justification for all memory operations.
	* Gorm.m: same as above.  Also added code to [Gorm unhide:]
	to prevent bringing forward the document window when 
	clicking on the app icon in test mode.
	
2004-05-06 21:21 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: [GormDocument selectClass:] do not switch if
	the class is one of GormSound or GormImage.   This prevents a harmless,
	but annoying message.

2004-05-05 22:18 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Gorm.m: [Gorm unhide:] improvement over previous fix to bring
	all things to front.   The code now toggles the active status of
	the document to cause all of the windows of the document to come
	to the front when the icon is clicked.
	
2004-05-02 18:35 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormImageEditor.m: Added code to allow it to resize the cells
	in the matrix according to the setting in preferences.
	* GormSoundEditor.m: Added code to allow it to resize the cells
	in the matrix according to the setting in preferences.
	* GormSoundView.m: Commented out some of the sound drawing code.
	I'm planning on getting this working later.
	* GormSoundInspector.gorm: Added images in buttons, rw.tiff, 
	rec.tiff, play.tiff, pause.tiff, and ff.tiff.
	
2004-05-02 23:40 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: [GormDocument openEditorForObject:]
	Do not bring the editor to the front if it's for an NSMenu.
	This prevents the "flash" bug which was apparent after the most
	recent fix for menu editing in Gorm.
	* GormNSMenu.m: Added #ifdef in GormNSMenu to conditionally compile
	[GormNSMenu display] so that it becomes easier to debug issues
	with NSMenu editing.
	
2004-05-01 17:40 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Documentation/Gorm.texi: Correction of itemize bullet, error
	found by Christopher Culver.
	
2004-05-01 11:46 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormSoundView.[hm]: New class to visualize the sound being
	inspected.
	* GormSoundInspector.m: Modifications so that it can now use
	a GormSoundView.
	* GormSoundInspector.gorm: Added soundView to .gorm file
	and made appropriate connections.
	
2004-05-01 11:18 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormClassInspector.m: Corrected a problem with the 
	wrong name being sent to the class manager.  This was causing
	an error to be printed by the class manager.   This problem
	had no effect, but was annoying.
	
2004-05-01 09:44 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Gorm.m: Added implementation for unhide: to bring forward the
	document window as well as any other windows. This corrects
	Report #3269.
	
2004-05-01 09:03 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormNSMenu.m: [GormNSMenu _createWindow] added call to
	setExcludedFromWindowsMenu: to make certain that the menu windows
	are not displayed in the Windows menu under Gorm's main menu.
	
2004-05-01 07:10 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormClassManager.m: Removed some NSLog messages.
	
2004-04-30 20:04 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Gorm.m: Removed code which calls "awakeFromDocument:" on
	objects loaded in palettes.
	* GormDocument.m: [GormDocument loadGormDocument:] added back
	code which calls awakeFromDocument:.  Also in [GormDocument
	setDocumentActive:] removed code which was causing all menus
	to display instead of just the main menu when loading a .gorm.
	* GormMenuEditor.m: [GormMenuEditor activate] removed code
	which was causing all submenus to be displayed when the editor
	for a menu was activated.
	* GormMenuInspectors.m: Removed awakeFromDocument: method.
	* GormNSMenu.m: Commented out some old code.
	
2004-04-30 19:15 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: Modified _repairFile so that it works. :)
	* Gorm.gorm: Removed some extraneous menu items/submenus.
	
2004-04-27 22:15 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Palettes/0Menus/GormMenuEditor.m: [GormMenuEditor deleteSelection]
	added code to re-display and resize after an item is deleted. This
	corrects the problem where the menu item doesn't immediately disappear
	from the screen when deleted.
	
2004-04-27 21:50 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormClassInspector.m: Added code to properly collapse the item
	if the class is being edited in the class inspector.
	* GormClassManager.m: some improvements on the previous fix.
	
2004-04-27 01:28 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormClassManager.m: Modified 
	[GormClassManager addAction:forClassNamed:],
	[GormClassManager addOutlet:forClassNamed:],
	[GormClassManager removeAction:fromClassNamed:],
	[GormClassManager removeOutlet:fromClassNamed:],
	[GormClassManager replaceAction:withAction:forClassNamed:],
	[GormClassManager replaceOutlet:withOutlet:forClassNamed:],
	to allow synchronization in the class list. When a outlet/action
	is added/removed/replaced the subclasses of that action stay
	in sync.
	
2004-04-26 01:04 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormClassInspector.m: Modifications to addAction: removeAction:
	addOutlet: & removeOutlet to syncronize with the classes outline
	view.
	* GormDocument.[hm]: exposed selectClass: method.
	* GormOutlineView.[hm]: Simplified some code and added a method
	called "reset" which stops the editing process on a class.
	
2004-04-25 23:24 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormClassInspector.m: removeOutlet: and removeAction: check for
	i >= 0 to allow deletion of last element.   This was an issue 
	introduced in the previous commit.  Also made the tables deselect
	the previous selection so that it would allow deselection of all
	rows.
	* GormClassInspector.gorm: Made both tables capable of having an
	empty selection.  This corrected an issue with deleting the last
	element.
	* GormDocument.m: Added back, in handleNotification:, handling of 
	GormDidModifyClassNotification.  Previously this was removed since
	there were no other places where the classes were being modified.
	This is no longer the case.
	
2004-04-25 06:34 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormClassInspector.m: removeOutlet: and removeAction: check for
	i > 0 to prevent and out of range exception if nothing is selected.

2004-04-18 08:30 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormPrefsController.m: Added dealloc to prevent any memory
	leaks.
	
2004-04-17 23:55 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Resources/GormPrefColors.gorm: New gorm file for color 
	preferences.
	* GormColorsPref.[hm]: new class to implement color 
	preferences.
	* GormViewEditor.m: Added code to allow the color of guidelines
	to be changed in preferences.
	* Defaults.plist: Added entry for GuideColor.  The default is red.
	
2004-04-17 13:11 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Palettes/3Containers/inspectors.m: Added code to the 
	GormTableViewInspector update the background color when
	the user changes it in the inspector.
	* Palettes/3Containers/GormNSTableViewInspector.gorm: added
	color well to allow changing of the background color.
	
2004-04-17 12:52 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormObjectEditor.m: [GormObjectEditor mouseDown:] check
	that "name" is not nil before proceeding into the code to
	do the drag & drop.   This was causing an exception.
	
2004-04-17 10:58 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Palettes/3Containers/GormNSOutlineView.m: Changed some of
	the default data source's elements to be closer to the actual
	class hierarchy.
	* Palettes/3Containers/inspectors.m: Added code to the 
	GormTableViewInspector to add or delete columns based on the
	new field which specifies the number of columns in the 
	table/outline.
	* Palettes/3Containers/main.m: removed some old code and
	added code to expand the outline view so it looks better
	in the palette.
	* Palettes/3Containers/GormNSTableViewInspector.gorm: added
	"#Columns" field to allow the user to modify the columns in the
	table without cutting/pasting.
	
2004-04-13 20:57 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Version 0.7.5
	
2004-04-11 21:26 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormBoxEditor.m: Cleaned up warnings.
	* GormImageEditor.m: same..
	* GormInternalViewEditor.m: same..
	* GormTabViewEditor.m: same..
	* GormViewEditor.m: same..
	* GormViewWithContentViewEditor.m: same..
	* Palettes/0Menus/main.m: same..
	* Palettes/3Containers/GormTableViewEditor.m: same..
	* Palettes/3Containers/inspectors.m: same..
	* Palettes/4Data/inspectors.m: same..
	* Palettes/4Data/main.m: same..
	* GormViewKnobs.m: Added reference to new header...
	* GormViewKnobs.h: New header which declares the knob 
	related functions.
	
2004-04-06 20:16 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>	

	* GormClassManager.m: Correction to how actions are added to 
	FirstResponder.  Previously it was adding *all* actions to this
	entry, but it shouldn't do this.   It now adds only those
	methods added to subclasses of NSResponder.
	
2004-04-06 00:16 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Palettes/2Controls/inspectors.m: added defaultItemForm attribute.
	Added code in [GormPopUpButtonAttributesInspector 
	_setValuesFromControl:] to select the appropriate item, when the
	value is changed in the inspector.
	* Palettes/2Controls/GormNSPopUpButtonInspector.gorm:
	corresponding changes to above code modifications.
	
2004-04-05 00:06 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: [GormDocument rebuildObjToNameMapping] some 
	additional debugging information.  Also in [GormDocument loadDocument:]
	unarchiver is now explicitly using RELEASE instead of AUTORELEASE.

2004-04-04 22:09 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: [GormDocument rebuildObjToNameMapping]
	use [[nameTable allKeys] objectEnumerator] instead of keyEnumerator.
	(slightly more efficient).
	
2004-04-04 12:30 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormInspectorsManager.m: Corrected some warnings and 
	streamlined the GormConnectionMananger.  Also added code in
	[GormConnectionManager updateButtons] to grey out the "ok"
	button when the connection isn't a valid one.
	* GormWindowEditor.m: Corrected some warnings.

2004-04-03 13:13 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormClassManager.m: Corrected a problem with renaming a class
	in [GormClassManager renameClassName:toClassName:].  The
	direct subclasses of the class whose name is being changed must
	be modified to have their superclass name set to the new name.
	* GormCustomView.m: Set the custom view to use the bold font to
	display the view name at the default size set by the user.
	* GormDocument.m: Corrected an issue with redisplay of the changed
	class name.   Also made some changes to correct some compiler
	warnings.
	* GormFontViewController.m: The default action of the font controller
	is now to set the "encodes default" to off, since this is what
	the user most often means when selecting a preset font.
	* GormInternalViewEditor.[hm]: 
	[GormInternalViewEditor changeFont:].  This allows the font to be
	modified on NSForms.
	* GormMatrixEditor.[hm]: same as above, except we're changing
	forms in a matrix.   These two classes don't derive from one
	another so the method had to, unfortunately, be duplicated.
	
2004-03-30 15:36 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormPalettesManager.m: [GormPaletteView draggedImage:endedAt:
	deposited:] added code to refresh the palette view after the
	drag is done.   This is a harmless, temporary fix for users of
	the art backend.
	
2004-03-24 15:36 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Palettes/GormMenuEditor.m: Minor cleanup which prevents
	menu from being dragged into a menu.
	* GormDocument.[hm]: Cleanup of reference to class GormProxyObject.
	Should have been GormObjectProxy.  Minor issue.
	
2004-03-24 01:00 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: [GormDocument attachObject:toParent:] changes
	to improve adding a new menu, if the main menu has been removed.
	* GormPalettesManager.m: [GormPaletteView draggedImage:endedAt:
	deposited:] added code to allow copying of menus in a similar
	fashion to windows.
	
2004-03-23 22:01 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Palettes/0Menus/GormMenuEditor.m: Added code to recursivly
	add all of the items and submenus to the document.
	* Palettes/0Menus/main.m: Added code to allow user to drag a new
	menu to the document.
	* Palettes/0Menus/GormMenuDrag.tiff: Image for menu to drag
	* Images/GormMenu.tiff: New image.
	
2004-03-21 23:15 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.[hm]: added [GormDocument _instantiateFontManager] 
	method to create the font manager when something requiring one 
	is added.  Other additions to the header to add the font manager
	functionality.   Removed declaration and references to old 
	GormFontManager class.  Modified attachObject:toParent: to properly
	detect when a menu item is being added which needs the font manager.
	* GormObjectProxy.m: Added implementation of imageForViewer
	to show a font manager icon, if the object is a NSFontManager or
	some subclass.
	* GormObjectEditor.m: Minor cleanup.
	
2004-03-21 10:27 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.[hm]: Initial code changes for new FontManager.
	Added code in [GormDocument attachObject:] to update the connection
	correctly.   Previously the connection were not being created correctly
	which require the user to disconnect the existing connection and 
	reconnect.
	* GormObjectEditor.m: Removed the check for NSFont as an object which
	can't be removed.   It will be possible to remove it once it has no
	connections.
	* Palettes/0Menus/main.m: Updated some of the connections here so
	that they are made properly when added to the document.  More work
	to come for the new FontManager implementation in Gorm.
	
2004-03-20 12:07 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* ClassInformation.plist: Removed some methods which should
	not have been in FirstResponder.
	* Gorm.m: Added back in the ability to instantiate a NSFontManager.
	Currently, IB adds a font manager for you when you add a NSMenu which
	has connections to the font manager.   Gorm, for the time being,
	will simply allow the user to instantiate it directly.
	* GormViewEditor.m: Removed _allsubviews: and associated fuctions.
	* GormFunctions.m: Added allSubviews and associated functions here
	so that they can be used application wide.
	* GormObjectEditor.m: [GormObjectEditor deleteSelection]: Added 
	code to query the user before deletion of the main menu, so that
	this doesn't happen by accident.  Added code to delete the subviews
	of a window from the document.

2004-03-13 07:45 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: [GormDocument loadDocument:] added call to 
	[GormDocument _repairFile] if a given default is true.  This gives
	the user the ability to repair older files which might have 
	issues.
	* GormFilesOwner.m: [GormFilesOwnerInspector setObject:] only
	return NSView subclasses if the object passed in is a
	GormCustomView.   This was causing an issue when users were simply
	arbitrarily setting the object without regard to this.
	* GormPalettesManager.m: Minor cleanup.
	
2004-03-05 01:45 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormViewWithSubviewsEditor.m: Removed call in
	[GormViewWithSubviewsEditor setOpened:] to setSelectionFromEditor:
	on GormDocument.  This was causing the object to be reset to
	NSWindow on save as well as some other issues.
	
2004-03-05 00:54 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormCustomClassInspector.m: Added an "if" in setObject: to
	prevent any problems if the object passed in is nil.
	* GormDocument.m: minor cleanup.
	* GormFilesOwner.m: minor cleanup.
	
2004-03-04 22:54 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormFilesOwner.m: -[GormFilesOwner init] changed the dimensions
	of browser.   Also made it so that the inspector shows up in 
	both the attributes and the custom class slots as expected.  This is
	like in IB under OS4.2. 
	
2004-03-04 01:08 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: [GormDocument setName:forObject:] added
	code to remap the name of an object if it is in the custom
	class map.
	
2004-03-03 11:00 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormCustomClassInspector.[hm]: Removed _currentSelection
	as it was redundant with the "object" ivar.  Rearranged the
	call for setObject:.  it was sligtly out of sync.  The user
	needed to click on the object twice to make certain everything
	is set properly.  Removed references to "correctClassName".
	* GormClassManager.[hm]: Removed the class method "correctClassName"
	the function is now done by overriding the "className" method
	when necessary to return the name of the class the Gorm* equivalent
	is standing in for.  This is a cleaner solution.
	* GormDocument.m: Removed all references to "correctClassName" in the
	_selectClass: method.
	* GormFilesOwner.m: Changed some NSLogs to NSDebugLog so that the
	selection of classes for the File's Owner wont display on the console
	what class was chosen.
	* Palettes/GormNSMenu.m: Added className.
	* Palettes/GormNSPanel.m: same.
	* Palettes/GormNSWindow.m: same.
	* Palettes/GormPopUpButtonEditor.m: Added className to implementation
	of GormNSPopUpButton and GormNSPopUpButtonCell.
	* Palettes/GormNSOutlineView: added className.
	* Palettes/GormNSTableView: same.
	
2004-02-29 11:56 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormCustomClassInspector.m: -[GormCustomClassInspector setObject:]
	corrected Report #7938.  Inspector now properly selects the subclass
	of the object when the .gorm is initially loaded.
	* GormInspectorsManager.m: Removed some uneeded calls to 
	"establishConnection".

2004-02-23 23:56 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* ClassInformation.plist: reformatted and added/removed some
	methods as needed.   These were pointed out be Deek/Jeff.
	
2004-02-21 13:48 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Defaults.plist: Add new default for "Archive
	Compatibility" section in preferences.
	* GormGeneralPref.[mh]: Added code for new section
	* GormDocument.m: Remove NSLogs, make NSDebugLog
	* GormInspectorsManager.m: Same
	* GormMatrixEditor.m: Same
	* GormSoundInspector.m: Same
	* GormSplitViewEditor.m: Same
	* GormViewWithSubviewsEditor.m: Same
	* GormWindowEditor.m: Same
	* Palettes/0Menus/GormMenuEditor.m: Same
	* Palettes/1Windows/main.m: Same
	* Palettes/2Controls/GormPopUpButtonEditor.m: Same
	* Resources/GormPrefGeneral.gorm: New section for "Archive
	Compatibility."  This currently doesn't work since the
	keyed archiving capability is not fully implemented.
	
2004-02-21 01:41 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormHeaderPref.m: Fixed header pre-loading.
	* GormHeaderPref.gorm: Added table instead of browser.
	* Palettes/3Containers/GormTableViewEditor.m: Removed
	some debugging information.
	* GormPrefGeneral.gorm: Added section for archive type
	preferences.
	
2004-02-19 00:50 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: -[GormDocument handleNotification:]
	added code to set inspector back to empty if the document
	is closed.

2004-02-15 13:11 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormClassInspector.m: -[GormClassInspector _refreshView] 
	Corrected an issue when user clicked on NSObject.  

2004-02-14 19:55 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormShelfPref.[hm]: Added controller class for new preferences
	module.
	* GormShelfPref.gorm: Added interface for new preferences
	module.
	Thanks to Enrico Sersale.  This preferences module for Gorm
	is based heavily on code that he wrote for GWorkspace.
	* Gorm.m: Definitions for notification.
	* GormPrivate.h: Declaractions for notification.
	
2004-02-12 22:42 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormClassInspector.m: Added category to allow direct manipulation
	of the classes view from the class inspector.  The new method is
	- (void) collapseClass: (NSString *)className.
	Modified [GormClassInspector selectClass:] to notify the user when
	the change has been made and only proceed on confirmation.
	Added code to delegate to prevent selection of a subclass of the 
	current class.
	* GormDocument.m: Cleaned up some of the code formatting in
	[GormDocument handleNotification:].
	
2004-02-12 02:02 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormClassInspector.m: Added new ivars/methods to support
	the new table for the feature mentioned in Report #7579.
	Basically it allows the user to change the parent class of
	of the currently selected class.  This is similar to feature
	which existed a while back, but was removed because it was
	very buggy.  Thanks to Stefan for suggesting this. GJC
	
2004-02-09 22:24 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Version 0.6.0
	
2004-02-08 11:43 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* ClassInformation.plist: Added change to NSWindow entry suggested
	by Stefan Urbanek.   The windowController outlet was missing from the
	list of outlets for this class.
	
2004-02-04 23:13 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: -[GormDocument attachObject:toParent:]
	added code to reset the target/action of an object after
	it's connection has been added to the connections list.
	Since the connections are restored when the .gorm is loaded,
	this prevents the target/action from being persisted when
	it's not going to get used anyway.
	* Palettes/1Windows/GormNSWindow.m: Added -(BOOL)canBecomeMainWindow
	implementation to return NO. (suggested by Jeff Tuniessen)
	
2004-02-01 18:21 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: -[GormDocument attachObject:toParent:]
	Added code to prevent menu actions from being re-added when
	clicking on menu items.
	
2004-01-31 21:21 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Palettes/0Menus/GormMenuEditor.m: -[GormMenuEditor activate]
	removed call to -[NSMenu display].  This corrects Report#3439.

2004-01-29 23:20 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormFunctions.[hm]: Factored out some common functions into
	this file.
	
2004-01-29 01:22 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormInternalViewEditor.m: Added code to -destroyAndListSubviews
	to remove the view from the document as appropriate.
	* GormSplitViewEditor.m: Same as above.
	* GormViewEditor.m: Added methods to handle view when inside the 
	scroll view directly as opposed to being contained in the NSView.
	* GormScrollViewEditor.m: Same as above.  Also added code to 
	handle removal of single view from the scroll view.  
	* GormViewWithContentViewEditor.m: Removed some debug code and
	added code in -groupSelectionInScrollView to add the view itself
	if there is only one view selected.
		
2004-01-25 17:59 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormInternalViewEditor.m: Change to remove dependency on internals
	of NSWindow: GSWindowView, in particular.
	
2004-01-20 08:53 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormViewWithContentViewEditor.m: Backing out previous change.
	
2004-01-17 23:07 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormViewEditor.[hm]: Addition of selection and makeSelectionVisible
	methods to allow views to exist within a scrollview without a
	containing NSView. 
	* GormViewWithContentViewEditor.m: Changed code in 
	groupSelectionInScrollView to not insert a NSView to contain the 
	subview being grouped in the case where there is only one
	view selected.   These fixes correct Report#6890.
		
2004-01-14 10:26 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* ClassInformation.plist: Added submenuAction: to the NSMenu
	class.
	
2004-01-14 01:42 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: attachObject:toParent: when the connection
	contained in the object which is attached is nil, use the 
	parent.   This corrects a minor issue with greyed out menu entries.
	
2004-01-11 13:08 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: Removed awakeFromDocument code and moved it to
	Gorm.m so that awakeFromDocument is called after all initialization is
	done.
	* Gorm.m: Added loop in open: to awake all objects in the nametable
	after loading.
	* Palettes/0Menus/GSMenuInspectors.m: Added code to close all of
	the uneeded menus upon loading.  This corrects Report #6467.
	
2004-01-06 01:12 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: [GormDocument attachObject:] added logic
	to automatically add predefined connections to the connectors
	array so that they can be manipulated in Gorm.  If a palette
	defines the destination to be the First Responder, 
	and the label to be "orderFrontStandardInfoPanel:" then this
	will be reflected in the connections inspector.
	* GormLib/IBConnectors.h: Made the comments into documentation
	style comments so, if/when I start using gsdoc to document the
	innerworkings of Gorm, it will be ready.
	
2004-01-04 22:39 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: Made -[GormDocument _identifierString:],
	-[GormDocument _formatAction:], and 
	-[GormDocument _formatAction:] into
	+[GormDocument identifierString:],
	+[GormDocument formatAction:], and 
	+[GormDocument formatAction:] so that they can be used
	in other classes which need to format actions/outlets.
	* GormDocument.h: Added declarations for the new class methods.
	* GormInspectorsManager.m: Use the new methods to prevent
	user from entering a bad name for an outlet or action.
	
2004-01-04 20:32 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormInspectorsManager.m: Added back some code to make the display
	of the title of the inspector more informative when editing a class.
	The title now reads: "Class Edit Inspector: {className}".  This code
	had been commented out a while back.

2004-01-03 02:08 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormClassInspector.m: Minor correction to -removeAction: and
	-removeOutlet: to prevent an exception being raised when 
	performing remove when there are not outlets/actions in the
	list.
	
2004-01-01 00:13 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Gorm.m: More usability changes to grey out menu items which
	can't/shouldn't be invoked.
	
2003-12-31 20:33 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Gorm.m: Corrected an issue with testInterface because of the new
	signature for awakeWithContext:.   Also added an alert to anyone
	loading bundles using GSAppKitUserBundles.   Bundles that replace
	classes of AppKit can cause issues in Gorm since they might interfere
	with encoding. 
	
2003-12-30 00:41 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: Removed uneeded method which was overriding
	awakeWithContext:.   This method is called from loadNibNamed: and, 
	since the GormDocument is a subclass, but is never loaded by that 
	method overriding the other implementation is uncessary.
	* ClassInformation.plist: Some of the parent information was wrong, 
	this was corrected.
	* Gorm.m: Added code in -validateMenuItem: to grey out certain menu
	items under given conditions.   This improves usability and prevents
	the user from corrupting the .gorm file by doing something that's
	not supported.	
	
2003-12-25 00:55 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Gorm.m: -validateMenuItem: added code to grey out 
	the "set name" menu item, if the object selected cannot 
	be renamed.
	
2003-12-24 23:17 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Gorm.m: Added a NS_DURING block around the main portions of the
	testInterface method and also added some of the classes to the list
	of classes which need to be translated from their "GormNS*" 
	equivalents.

2003-12-23 23:32 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Gorm.m: Update the minor release number.  Add call to 
	method which checks if an object is a "top level object" 
	before allowing the user to rename it.
	* GormClassInspector.m: There was a bug which was preventing 
	users from removing outlets/actions.  Also added a call to 
	the method which removes connections when an outlet or action 
	is deleted from the document.
	* GormClassManager.m: Added code to correct problem removing 
	actions/outlets. The outlets were not being properly deleted 
	from the dictionary. 
	* GormCustomClassInspector.m: The special case for 
	NSSecureTextField, which allows it to replace NSTextField, 
	was not properly replacing the cell with a secure one for 
	archiving.   A new method called _replaceCellClassForObject:
	className: was added to allow the cell to be replace as 
	appropriate for the assigned class.
	* GormDocument.[hm]: Added code to properly notify the class 
	inspector when something is deleted from the class it's editing.  
	Added implementation for isTopLevelObject.
	* GormSetNameController.m: Removed RELEASE for outlets.  
	RELEASE and deallocation of the toplevel panel object 
	should release the outlets pointed to by the gorm file.
	* Testing/GormTest.gorm: Added.
	* Testing/GormTest.m: Modified to use the .gorm file.
	
2003-12-23  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* GormLib/GNUmakefile (libGorm_LIBRARIES_DEPEND_UPON): Add 
	FOUNDATION_LIBRARY depend.
	* GormLib/GNUmakefile.preamble: Idem for libobjc on mingw and cygwin.

2003-11-29 00:28 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: -detachObject: extra RELEASE was causing
	a double release when the editor for an object was deallocating
	itself.  This was (intermittently) causing a segfault when 
	deleting an element from the gui.
	
2003-11-28 18:26 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormClassManager.[hm]: Slight modification allCustomSubclassesOf: 
	previously there was a special case which added NSPanel for NSWindow.
	That has been taken out.
	* GormCustomClassInspector.m: Call method in class manager to 
	get the subclasses.  Undoes previous change for Report #6345.
	See that report on savannah for more information.
	* Palettes/2Controls/GormNSSliderInspector.gorm: Changed Disabled
	checkbox to "Enabled" since this is the way it was being treated
	in the code and this is how it's done across the rest of the app.

2003-11-24 01:37 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Palettes/0Menus/GormMenuEditor.m: Minor change to correct assertion failure.
	
2003-11-23 23:00 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Version 0.5.0

2003-11-23 15:28 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormClassManager.[hm]: Added method allSubclassesOf: to get all
	subclasses whether custom or not.
	* GormCustomClassInspector.m: Call new method in class manager to 
	get the subclasses.  Corrects Report #6345.
	
2003-11-23 10:08 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Palettes/1Windows/GormNSPanel.m: Added flag to allow resizing of 
	the panel in Gorm.  Corrects Report #6344.

2003-11-19 01:00 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: Removed AUTORELEASE from creation of placeholders
	for both the image and the sound.   This was causing a segfault.
	
2003-11-15 16:53 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormViewWithContectViewEditor.m: Added methods 
	_shouldBeVertical and _sortByPosition:isVertical: and 
	enhanced the groupSelectionInSplitView method to allow 
	positional orientation of the splitview.  The user should
	now expect the splitview to be built based on the relative 
	position of the views in the window being edited.  This fix 
	addresses Report/Bug #5253.
	
2003-11-12 00:27 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormViewEditor.m: Removed extra RELEASE which was causing
	a segfault.

2003-11-11 17:27 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	was causing a segmentation fault.

2003-11-01 20:35 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormInspectorsManager.m: -ok: method.  Removed check which was
	preventing connection to NSFirst.

	* GormBoxEditor.m: Removed commented out code.
	* GormControlEditor.m: same

	to be loaded.  The old templates are for backwards compatibility
	only and will be removed in future versions of both GNUstep and
	Gorm.

2003-10-19 23:12 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormOutlineView.m: Corrected issue in addAttributeToClass which
	was adding to the total line count before validating that the item
	was added successfully.
	
2003-10-19 01:00 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Palettes/0Menus/GormMenuInspectors.m: setObject fix for 
	segmentation fault.  After menu is deleted, the object is not
	cleared from the inspector.   This fix sets the old object to nil
	before setting the new one.
	* Gorm.[hm]: Added constant for new notification.  Updated patch level.
	
2003-10-18 02:22 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormViewEditor.m: Added _allsubviews and _subviewsForView:withArray:
	to collect all of the views which need to be detached when a
	parent view is removed from the GUI.  This is used the in implementation
	of detachSubviews.

2003-10-12 23:25 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormInspectorsManager.m: Corrected method of disassociating
	connection after exception.
	* GormMenuEditor.m: Added _findAll:withArray: and _findAllSubmenus:
	to recursively collect all objects which should be deleted from the
	nameTable when the user deletes a menu item.
	* Palettes/0Menus/GormMenuInspectors.m: Eliminated uneeded variable
	and corrected method being called to eliminate previous setting
	of services/window menu.
	* Palettes/0Menus/GormNSMenu.m: Beginnings of fix to prevent Gorm
	from loading all menus at once.

2003-10-12 01:49 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	Added declarations for methods setWindowsMenu, setServicesMenu,
	servicesMenu, windowsMenu.
	* GormDocument.m: Added implementation of above methods.
	* Palettes/0Menus/GormMenuInspectors.m: Added implementation of method
	updateMenuType which sets the menu appropriately so that when
	the file is unarchived the proper menu setting is reflected.
	* Palettes/0Menus/GormMenuAttributesInspector.m: Added connection
	for method updateMenuType.
	* Resources/Gorm.gorm: Designated services and windows menus for Gorm.

2003-09-27 21:58 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Palettes/0Menus/GNUmakefile: Add .gorm files for new inspectors
	* Palettes/0Menus/GormMenuEditor.m: Re-added assertion to ensure 
	consistency.  Code cleanup: Got rid of some commented out code and
	some code which was for logging purposes only.
	* Palettes/0Menus/GormNSMenu.m: Removed some old code which was for
	debugging.
	* Palettes/0Menus/GormMenuInspectors.m: Removed hardcoded GUI and
	replaced it with the loading of the appropriate .gorm files for each

	menu item inspector.

2003-09-08  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormClassManager.m: [nonCustomSuperClassOf:] if the class
	passed in is not custom it will return the immediate superclass
	of that class.   This is to allow the use of the custom class
	mechanism to select classes which are not custom but are not
	offered in the palettes (i.e. NSSecureTextField).

2003-09-08  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	comitted by Gregory Casamento
	
	* GormSetName.gorm: New gorm file for setname panel.
	* GormSetNameController.[hm]: Controls the actions of the panel
	* Gorm.m: Modified the portion of code which calls the 
	panel

2003-09-07  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormInspectorsManager.m: Similar to the previous check.  Modified
	-[ok:] such that if a connection is established and for any reason
	causes an exception, the connection is removed and an error message
	is displayed describing what caused the connection to fail.
	
2003-09-07  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormInspectorsManager.m: Added check in -[ok:] to determine if
	selected destination is valid.  If it is nil an alert panel is shown.
	This will help prevent the creation of invalid connections.

2003-09-07  Andrew Ruder <aeruder@ksu.edu>
	comitted by Gregory Casamento

	* Gorm.m: Added use of new sharedGormFontViewController

	NSStepperCell.
	
2003-09-01  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Version 0.3.1

2003-09-01  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormViewEditor.m: Added code to allow saving of image as part of 
	the view.  This provides a fix for Report #4390 and #4852.

2003-08-30  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: Added blank implementation of awakeWithContext:
	since this method is only used to establish connections in a live
	application.  This should not be done when the file is loaded
	into Gorm itself.

2003-08-30  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormImageEditor.m: Minor correction to allow compilation with
	gcc < 3.x. (found my Riccardo Mattola/grey_gandalf)

2003-08-28  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: Minor correction to allow compilation with
	gcc < 3.x.

2003-08-28  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: Cleanup some of the extra logs.
	* GormClassInspector.m: Add logic to prefent index out of bounds
	exception.

2003-08-27  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: Corrected some memory related issues.
	* GormCustomClassManager.m: Added to log which informs
	user of a nil object returned from the name map.
	* Gorm.m: Cleaned up some comments and updated the version of
	the application.

2003-08-26  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: Added some debug logs.  And in
	_replaceObjectsWithTemplates: modified the method to use the
	customClassMap call instead of accessing the map directly.
	* GormClassManager.m: renameClassNamed: and removeClassNamed: both
	were failing to delete the custom class associations when a custom
	class is renamed or removed.  Added the code to do this.
	* GormCustomClassInspector.m: Added check for nil return from the
	classManager.   Code will print a warning to stdout, if this happens.

2003-08-23  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: Corrected selection problem.  Moved code to
	select item in classes view from GormInspectorManager.
	* GormInspectorManager.m: Removed the code from here.

2003-08-23  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Palettes/Containers/main.m: added height resize flag
	to TextView prototype to correct bug #3270

2003-08-23  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.[hm]: Made selectClassWithObject public.
	* GormInspectorManager.m: Added logic to call selectClassWithObject
	so that when an object is selected, the classes view focuses on it.
	
2003-08-22  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormClassManager.m: Removed extraneous release calls.  In most
	cases only initWithCapacity and such were being called to create
	dictionaries.  These are not retained, so they will be garbage 
	collected.
	* GormDocument.m: Corrected detachObject: method to handle scroll
	views.  The document view was not being deleted from the custom class
	list, so Gorm was saving a corrupted .gorm file.

2003-08-22  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: Removed refrences to old template classes.
	Added code to use new template classes and fixed several 
	bugs.
	* Gorm.m: Removed old subclasses for deprecated template classes.
	* GormPrivate.h: Removed subclasses for deprecated template classes.
	* GormLib/IBConnectors.[hm]: added nibInstantiate method.

	that it is not used uninitialized if the first event is not 
	NSLeftMouseUp.

2003-08-10  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocuments.m: -[GormDocument
	pasteType:fromPasteBoard:parent:] Added check to determine if
	frame is responded to by the object being copied.  This was
	failing on NSMenuItem.

2003-08-09  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormCustomView.m: Corrected obsolete header reference.
	* GormInspectorsManager.m: Removed extra establishConnection call
	which was causing a problem when removing connections from
	NSOwner.

2003-08-04  Fabien Vallon  <fabien@sonappart.net>

	* Add a good when adding Images

2003-08-04  Fabien Vallon  <fabien@sonappart.net>

	* GormImageEditor.m : Fix dnd (Todo : accept NSTIFFPboardType)
	(code borrow from Terminal.app by Alexander Malmberg)
	

2003-08-01  Fabien Vallon  <fabien@sonappart.net>

	* GormDocument.m : Add offset when pasting

	outlets.
	
2003-06-19  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: Moved declaration of GSNibItem in instantiateClass:

2003-05-22  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: Made the IB*RemoveConnectorNotification being
	sent in removeConnector: the document instead of the connector which
	was removed.  This prevents a core dump which was occurring when
	loading a gorm and removing or renaming outlets/actions.

	behavior when a class is loaded by Gorm. (see Apple's interface 
	builder framework)

2003-05-10  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	not adding views to the document.   Added a method which adds 
	the view and it's subviews.  This fix corrects bug#3490.   
	
2003-05-10  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

2003-05-10  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: Further improved the fix to the problem found
	yesterday.  The custom class code was issuing a RELEASE call to 
	all of the objects in the nameTable.   This was not necessary unless
	the object is a template object and was causing some issues with
	gorm file corruption.

2003-05-08  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: Corrected a problem which was causing the 
	NSVisible array in the nameTable to become corrupted when

	for saving documents.
	* GormDocument.h: ditto
	* GormDocument.m: as above, plus a few fixes for bugs that have crept
	in to the toolbar due to gui changes ... tweak layout a little, make
	the button highlighting correct, and use a button subclass to avoid
	new matrix behavior of setting the buttons to do the ugly
	showsFirstResponder stuff.

2003-03-06  Gregory Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormFilesOwner.m: Corrected minor problem with updating
	class names for the file's owner inspector.   It was not updating
	the list when reselecting the same object, so new classes were not
	being displayed.
	
2003-03-05  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Version: 0.2.6

	ensuring that highlighting of browser elements correctly indicates
	established connections clearly.

2003-02-10  Pierre-Yves Rivaille <pyrivail@ens-lyon.fr>

	* GormInspectorsManager.m: _internalCall:
	only reload the column when needed, this was causing segfaults
	with the new lockFocus code.

2003-02-02  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Palettes/3Containers/GormTableViewEditor.m: missing
	"else" was causing an exception to be thrown when attempting
	to delete a column in NSTableView when nothing is selected.
	
2003-01-23  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>
	
	* Gorm.m: Some general cleanup.  Removed the startuptime

2003-01-22  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Gorm.m: Removed reference to NSImageDoesCaching.
	This variable was removed in the gui library and was causing

	* GormDocument.[hm]: Added code to support the deferred
	flag for windows.  setObject:isDeferred: and 
	objectIsDeferred: were added.
	* Palettes/main.m: Added support for deferred flag.
	I didn't enable the flag in the gui, since
	NSBundleAdditions.m needs to be changed to allow this
	flag to be used.  Once that's done, it will be enabled.
	
2003-01-14  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormDocument.m: replaceTemplatesWithObjects: when
	restoring the editing object the template was not

	* Documentation/Gorm.texi: Modified docs to show current
	status of Gorm.
	
2003-01-09  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

2002-11-23  Gregory John Casamento  <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Gorm.m: -[GormClassProxy classInspectorClassName]:

	* GormDocument.[hm]: added -[GormDocument removeConnectionsWithLabel: 
	(NSString *)name forClassNamed: (NSString *)className
	isAction: (BOOL)action.  This method removes the connections relavent
	to an action/outlet when it's name is changed.  I also modified the
	delegate to call it and to present the user w/ an alert panel.  This
	is consistent w/ how InterfaceBuilder behaves.
	
2002-11-20  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* GModelDecoder.m
	([GormObjectProxy -initWithModelUnarchiver:]): Retain the className.

	GormImageEditor and GormSoundEditor.
	* GormImageEditor.m: new class to deal with Images.
	* GormSoundEditor.m: refactored code with GormGenericEditor,
	now looks like GormImageEditor.m

	[GormClassManager -customClassMap]
	to NSMutableDictionary and set parameter of 
	[GormClassManager -setCustomClassMap:] to NSMutableDictionary.
	* GormClassManager.m: [GormClassManager -setCustomClassMap:]
	now simply assigns the class map instead of copying it.
	* GormCustomClassInspector.m: Copy the name of the class from 
	the cell using [NSString stringWithString:] instead of using 
	the value directly which might cause memory issues.  Also changed 
	code to remove the custom class mapping if if the class is 
	mapped back to the parent class name.
	* GormDocument.m: Set the version of the GormDocument class in the
	[GormDocument +initialize] method.   Removed some commented out code
	in the [GormDocument -_createSoundPlaceHolder:] method.   In
	[GormDocument -beginArchiving] and [GormDocument -endArchiving] added 
	code to avoid template replacement, if we are in testing mode.  This 
	corrected a core dump when testing w/ a .gorm that used custom 
	classes.  Moved place where the custom classes are set 
	in [GormDocument -loadDocument] which was causing a core dump.

	gorm file package when the .gorm is saved and registering them w/
	Gorm when the package is subsequently loaded.
	* GormPrivate.h: Added class declaration for GormSound, the
	sound placeholder class.  This class contains the minimal information
	needed to handle sounds in Gorm.

	variable.
	* GormDocument.m: Added -[_replaceObjectsWithTemplates] and
	-[replaceTemplatesWithObjects] which are called from -[beginArchiving]

	* GormDocument.m: -[GormDocument setSelectionFromEditor:]
	added conditional to test if a given editor responds to

2002-08-17  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Palettes/3Containers/main.m: The scroll view for the table view and
	outline view were not being added to the window prior to the

2002-07-22  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Resources/GormCustomClassInspector.[gorm,classes]: Added.
	* GormCustomClassInspector.[hm]: Added.	Custom class support is not 
	fully functional.   I am currently working on it, but I thought 
	it would be useful to commit the code sooner rather than later.
	* Gorm.m: Made some fixes to prevent core dump.
	* GormClassManager.m: Removed some debugging NSLog calls and
	added logic to prevent the addition of duplication outlets/actions
	to a class.
	* GormDocument.m: Finished up the delete functionality.   Added code
	to show an alert panel when the user tries to add a duplicate outlet/
	action to the class.
	* GormOutlineView.m: Added method to allow deletion of a given
	row directly from the outline view.
	* GormInspectorsManager.m: Modified to pop up button to show custom
	class inspector as an option.

2002-07-21  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormClassManager.[hm]: Added some methods to support custom
	classes:
	
	- (NSArray*) customSubClassesOf: (NSString *)superclass;
	- (NSArray*) allCustomSubclassesOf: (NSString *)superclass;

	and also made some corrections in the replaceOutlet to correct a
	problem with editing in the classes view.
	
2002-07-16  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormObjectInspector.m: Removed extra RELEASE at line 93 which
	was causing core dump.
	* GormTableViewEditor.m: Removed [document detachObject: selected]
	since this was deleting the reference in the map to the table when 
	a column was deleted making connections impossible.

2002-07-14  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>
	
	* GormClassManager.[hm]: Added methods to support deletion of
	classes, outlets, and actions.

2002-07-14  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormClassManager.[hm]: Added new methods:
	- (NSString *) addNewActionToClassNamed: (NSString *)name;
 	- (NSString *) addNewOutletToClassNamed: (NSString *)name;
 	- (BOOL) loadCustomClasses: (NSString*)path;
 	- (BOOL) isCustomClass: (NSString *)className;
 	- (BOOL) isAction: (NSString *)actionName 
		ofClass: (NSString *)className;
 	- (BOOL) isOutlet: (NSString *)
		outletName ofClass: (NSString *)className;	
	Changed the format of the ".classes" file to store only the 
	custom classes.  This is more efficient since the full class 
	list is already loaded when the GormClassManager is 
	initialized.  The custom class list is merged with this
	to create the display shown in the classes view.
	* GormDocument.m: modified to utilize the above routines in 
	the method which loads the .gorm file and the data source.
	* GormOutlineView.m: Added new methods to add new actions/outlets 
	with generic names so that the user can edit the actions/outlets 
	once added.
	
2002-07-13  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Gorm.m: Corrected typo in method name.   Added check to prevent
	addition of blank action, outlet or class name.
	* GormClassManager.m: started on modifications for custom classes.
	
2002-07-12  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	added to the class manager to edit the contents of the class list.
	* GormOutlineView.[hm]: Added methods to add actions and outlets
	to the data source from the outline view.  Also changed the drawing
	code so that the outlet/action being edited doesn't shift when
	clicked.

2002-07-11  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormClassManager.m: Added stubs for two new method to add actions
	and outlets based on classname.
	* GormDocument.m: Added logic set the name in the data source methods.
	* GormOutlineView.m: Override [-editColumn:row:withEvent:select:]
	to draw correcty for the outlet/actions.
	* GormOutlineView.h: Move GormOutletActionHolder to header so it
	can be used by the data source.

2002-07-09  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Gorm.m: Added new menu item and method to add outlet/action
	-[Gorm addAttributeToClass:]
	* GormDocument.m: Added new method which gets called by the one
	in Gorm.m and passes control to the classesView.
	* GormOutlineView.m added -[GormOutlineView addAttributeToClass]
	to add either an outlet or an action depending on what type 
	is currently open.  Currently it only adds the name and doesn't
	modify the datasource.  The next version will.
	
2002-07-08  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormOutlineView.m -[drawRow:] Added logic to draw inverse
	image of the outlet or action button to visually indicate which
	is being edited in the outline view.
	* GormOutlineView.h: Added typedef to indicate whether actions or
	outlets are being edited.
	* Images/GormActionSelected.tiff: Added
	* Images/GormOutletSelected.tiff: Added
	* GNUmakefile: Modified to copy images to the resources directory.
	
2002-07-08  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormOutlineView.[hm] : Added.   This is a NSOutlineView
	subclass handles outlets and actions for the class view.  
	As of this revision, you can view the actions and outlets of
	a class, but you can't edit them.
	* GormDocument.m: Modified to use new class.
	* GormInspectorsManager.m: Removed some code which was causing
	the application to dump core on exit.

2002-05-04  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* GormClassEditor.m: Added blank implementation of
	[GormClassEditor -makeSelectionVisible:(BOOL)] method.   
	When creating a new class and editing it, the application was 
	throwing an exception due to the abcense of this method.  
	It now seems to function correctly.
	
2002-04-08  Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Palettes/0Menus/GormNSMenu.m
	[GormNSMenu -_createWindow]: removed NSLog statement before
