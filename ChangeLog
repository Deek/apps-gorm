	Rewrote testing mechanism so that we test by creating an in-memory
	nib, and load that nib.  This way, the testing process has no effect
	on the original objects in the document we are working on.
	Also changed the editor api so that we have a deactivate method.
	Editors are deactivated on archiving and reactivated afterwords -
	this means that we no longer need to destroy all editors during
	archiving in order to stop them being included in the archive.
