Introduction
============

Read the NEWS file for the latest user visible changes. Read the INSTALL
file for installation instructions.

   Gorm is an acronym for Graphic Object Relationship modeler (or
perhaps GNUstep Object Relationship Modeler).

   Gorm is a clone of the NeXTstep `Interface Builder' application for
GNUstep.

   Gorm is not `gormless' (a Yorkshire dialect word that my parents
used when they spotted me staring, slack-jawed, at the TV).

   Gorm is part of the GNUstep project, and is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation.

   Gorm is released under the GPL - see the file `COPYING' for details.

   Little documentation exists. There is a nice basic tutorial at
<http://www.gnustep.it/pierre-yves/index.html>.

Status
======

   Gorm is now completely usable.  The necessary functionality to 
support custom classes has been implemented and Gorm should now support
any user defined widget or AppKit widget.   Bugs in Gorm should be
reported to the bug-gnustep mailing list, to one of the authors, or
on savannah.gnu.org.

   Known problems (things to do) -

  1. Documentation - only a tiny start has been made on this!
