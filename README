At this point, Gorm is usable only for very simple stuff as it only supports
the most commonly used gui elements.  However, the binary format in which
documents are archived is stable, so documents created using Gorm now should
remain useful.
Interface test mode qorks quite nicely - you really can see things working.

Known problems (things to do) -

1. Documentation - only a tiny start has been made on this!

2. Support for custom objects needs to be added.

3. Editors and inspectors need writing for most gui elements -
  popup menus
  boxes
  browsers
  scrollviews
  splitviews
  etc etc

4. Support for color and images on buttons etc.
  This requires improved image and color support in the gui library

5. Support for fonts etc
  This requires improved font management support in the gui library
