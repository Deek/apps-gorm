Introduction
============

Read the NEWS file for the latest user visible changes. Read the INSTALL
file for installation instructions.

   Gorm is an acronym for Graphic Object Relationship modeler (or
perhaps GNUstep Object Relationship Modeler).

   Gorm is a clone of the NeXTstep `Interface Builder' application for
GNUstep.

   Gorm is not `gormless' (a Yorkshire dialect word that my parents
used when they spotted me staring, slack-jawed, at the TV).

   Gorm is part of the GNUstep project, and is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation.

   Gorm is released under the GPL - see the file `COPYING' for details.

Status
======

   25 Feb 2000

   At this point, Gorm is usable only for very simple stuff as it only
supports the most commonly used gui elements.  However, the binary
format in which documents are archived is stable, so documents created
using Gorm now should remain useful.  Interface test mode qorks quite
nicely - you really can see things working.

   Known problems (things to do) -

  1. Documentation - only a tiny start has been made on this!

  2. Support for custom objects needs to be added.

  3. Editors and inspectors need writing for most gui elements -
     popup menus   boxes   browsers   scrollviews   splitviews   etc etc

  4. Support for color and images on buttons etc.    This requires
     improved image and color support in the gui library

  5. Support for fonts etc   This requires improved font management
     support in the gui library
