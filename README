Introduction
============

Read the NEWS file for the latest user visible changes. Read the INSTALL
file for installation instructions.

   Gorm is an acronym for Graphic Object Relationship modeler (or
perhaps GNUstep Object Relationship Modeler).

   Gorm is a clone of the NeXTstep `Interface Builder' application for
GNUstep.

   Gorm is part of the GNUstep project, and is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation.

   Gorm is released under the GPL - see the file `COPYING' for details.

   Little documentation exists. There is a nice basic tutorial at
<http://www.gnustep.it/pierre-yves/index.html>.

of the major functionality is now implemented.  Please report bugs to
bug-gnustep@gnu.org
