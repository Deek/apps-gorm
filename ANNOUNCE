This is version 0.7.5 of Gorm.

What is Gorm?
=============

   Gorm is an acronym for Graphic Object Relationship modeler (or
perhaps GNUstep Object Relationship Modeler).

   Gorm is a clone of the NeXTstep `Interface Builder' application for
GNUstep.

Noteworthy changes in version `0.7.5'
=====================================

   * The 'reparent' feature in the class inspector.  This allows the
     user to change the class hierarchy from within Gorm.

   * Some important bugfixes

   * a property 'GormRepairFileOnLoad' (untested) which  should repaire
     old .gorm files... It is HIGHLY recommended that Gorm not be run
     with this on constantly and that you back up any files which you
     want to repair before opening them with this option turned on.

   * A shelf inspector in prefs that lets you expand the size of the
     names in the object view..

   * Support for NSFontManager

   * A way to restore a complete NSMenu if it's deleted (a new palette
     entry for NSMenu, not just an item)
