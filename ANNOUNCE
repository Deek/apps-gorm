This is version 0.9.0 of Gorm.

What is Gorm?
=============

   Gorm is an acronym for Graphic Object Relationship modeler (or
perhaps GNUstep Object Relationship Modeler).

   Gorm is a clone of the NeXTstep `Interface Builder' application for
GNUstep.

Noteworthy changes in version `0.9.0'
=====================================

   * Images/Sounds can now be dragged into a matrix cell.

   * Fully implemented date and number formatter inspectors (these
     classes still need work in GUI).

   * Added warning panel if the user attempts to edit a .gorm file
     created with a newer version of Gorm

   * Modified data.classes format so that only those actions
     specifically added to FirstResponder are listed.

   * Greatly improved gmodel importation. (experimental)

   * It's now possible to add methods to classes which are not custom.
     This allows the user to add actions which may have been added to
     those classes by categories.

   * Completely new header parser implemented.

   * Improved cut/paste.  It's now possible to use cut/paste from
     almost anywhere.  The class editor now fully supports it.

   * Improved implementation of some of the InterfaceBuilder framework
     classes.

   * Object editor will now remove all instances of a class that has
     been deleted from the class editor.

   * The class inspector and the classes view will now apply stricter
     rules to names of actions and outlets to ensure that they are
     properly entered.

   * All inspectors work perfectly with customized colors.

   * Fixed a number of bugs.
