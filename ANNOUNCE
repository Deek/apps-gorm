This is version 0.2.5 of Gorm.

What is Gorm?
=============

   Gorm is an acronym for Graphic Object Relationship modeler (or
perhaps GNUstep Object Relationship Modeler).

   Gorm is a clone of the NeXTstep `Interface Builder' application for
GNUstep.

   Gorm is not `gormless' (a Yorkshire dialect word that my parents
used when they spotted me staring, slack-jawed, at the TV).

Noteworthy changes in version `0.2.5'.
======================================

   Many fixes and improvements to make the app work better.

   * Better parsing of headers

   * Interface code redone as gorm files.

   * Re-add multiple selection via mouse drag.

How can I get support for this software?
========================================

   You may wish to use the GNUstep discussion mailing list for general
questions and discussion.  Look at the GNUstep Web Pages for more
information regarding GNUstep resources <http://www.gnustep.org/>

Where can you get it?  How can you compile it?
==============================================

<ftp://ftp.gnustep.org/pub/gnustep/dev-apps>.

Where do I send bug reports?
