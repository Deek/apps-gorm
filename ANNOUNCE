What is Gorm?
=============

   Gorm is an acronym for Graphic Object Relationship modeler (or
perhaps GNUstep Object Relationship Modeler).

   Gorm is a clone of the NeXTstep `Interface Builder' application for
GNUstep.

Noteworthy changes in version `0.3.0'
=====================================

   * Preferences added.

   * User can now enable and disable guidlines for easier editing.

   * Refactored code into GormLib which is a clone of the
     InterfaceBuilder framework.  This facilitates creating palettes
     and inspectors outside of Gorm.

   * Added class inspector for easier editing of classes.  This gives
     the user the option to use either the outline view or the
     inspector to edit new classes.

   * Added inspectors for the following: NSScrollView,
     NSProgressIndicator, NSColorWell, GormImageInspector (for images
     added to .gorm files).
