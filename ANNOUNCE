This is version 0.11.0 of Gorm.

What is Gorm?
=============

   Gorm is an acronym for Graphic Object Relationship modeler (or
perhaps GNUstep Object Relationship Modeler).

   Gorm is a clone of the NeXTstep `Interface Builder' application for
GNUstep.

Noteworthy changes in version `0.11.0'
======================================

   * Improved implementation of canSubstituteForClass: the default
     implementation of this method tests the classes to see if
     initWithCoder: or encodeWithCoder: is implemented on a subclass to
     determine automatically if that class has the same encoding
     signature as the original class, if it does, it can be substituted.

   * Improved handling of classes which use cell classes in the custom
     class inspector.  The inspector now autmatically replaces the cell
     class with the appropriate one when the user selects a given
     subclass.

   * Browser based class editor in document panel.   This interface is
     more like the one on OSX.  The user now has a choice in
     preferences to determine which view they would like to use.

   * Translation tools.  The Document->Translate menu allows the user
     to export string and import strings in the strings format, so that
     someone can easily translate just the strings in the file and
     doesn't need to directly edit anything in Gorm.  The strings file
     can then be loaded back into Gorm and all of the relevant strings
     are updated.

   * Alignment tools.  In the new Layout menu there are options to
     align views, center views, bring views to front or push them to
     the back of the view layers.

   * Implementation of IBViewResourceDraggingDelegate.  This allows
     updating of the pull down in the inspectors panel dynamically.  It
     requires the developer of a palette to implement some code to
     enable this, as on OSX.

   * Lots of bugfixes and usability changes are also included in this
     release.
