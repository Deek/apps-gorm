This is version 0.8.0 of Gorm.

What is Gorm?
=============

   Gorm is an acronym for Graphic Object Relationship modeler (or
perhaps GNUstep Object Relationship Modeler).

   Gorm is a clone of the NeXTstep `Interface Builder' application for
GNUstep.

Noteworthy changes in version `0.8.0'
=====================================

   PLEASE NOTE: It is important for this release that you upgrade to
Gorm 0.8.0 when using Gorm with the new GNUstep libraries (base-1.10.0
and gui-0.9.4).  This version of Gorm contains some features which are
reliant on changes made in those versions of the libraries.  It is
stated in Gorm's documentation (the Gorm.texi file) that this is
required, but I felt it important enough to also mention it here so
that it is known beyond a reasonable doubt.

   * New gorm file version.

   * Full custom palette support

   * Palette preferences panel to allow the user to configure palettes
     to load

   * Experimental: Standalone views.  This feature is to allow the use
     of a view without the need of a containing window.   This allows
     developers to treat these views as they would any other top level
     object in the .gorm file.  This is experimental functionality.

   * Improved NSTableColumn inspector.  The new inspector allows the
     user to change the data cell used for a given column.   This
     allows the user to select from a list of cell subclasses and set
     the appropriate custom or non-custom one they want to appear in
     that column of the table.

   * Improved layout of some of the inspectors.

   * Removed old class parser.  The parser was somewhat buggy and was
     actually causing some issues.  A new parser will be available in
     the next version of Gorm.  For now users will need to use the
     class inspector or the outline view to enter classes into Gorm.

   * Experimental: "File" section.  This is essentially a per-file
     preference which allows the user to control which version of
     GNUstep a given file will be compatible with.  It also lists the
     potential compatibility issues with the selected version.

   * Improved controls palette.  New items for some of the standard
     font replace the old "Title" widget which was a System-14 font.
     The new widgets use a selection of the standard System font to
     allow the user to easily build a gui using these and reducing the
     amount of time the user needs to spend fiddling with the font
     panel.

How can I get support for this software?
========================================

   You may wish to use the GNUstep discussion mailing list for general
questions and discussion.  Look at the GNUstep Web Pages for more
information regarding GNUstep resources <http://www.gnustep.org/>

Where can you get it?  How can you compile it?
==============================================

   You can download sources and rpms (for some machines) from
<ftp://ftp.gnustep.org/pub/gnustep/dev-apps>.

Where do I send bug reports?
============================

   Bug reports can be sent to <bug-gnustep@gnu.org>.
