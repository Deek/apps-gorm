This is version 0.4.0 of Gorm.

What is Gorm?
=============

   Gorm is an acronym for Graphic Object Relationship modeler (or
perhaps GNUstep Object Relationship Modeler).

   Gorm is a clone of the NeXTstep `Interface Builder' application for
GNUstep.

Noteworthy changes in version `0.4.0'
=====================================

   * New Menu and Menu Item inspectors.

   * User can now specify the Services and Windows menus in the menu
     inspector.

   * User can specify a non-custom subclass as well as a custom one to
     replace the class when the .gorm is unarchived.  This can be used
     to turn a NSTextField into NSSecureTextField and etc.

   * New set name panel.

   * New switch control on the font panel to allow the user to specify
     if a font is encoded with its default size or not.

   * Added NSStepper and NSStepperCell to the class list to allow
     creation of custom subclasses.

   * Windows and Services menus now function correctly.
