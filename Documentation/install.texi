You need to have the GNUstep core libraries installed in order to compile
and use Gorm. The core packages are, at a minimum:

@itemize @bullet
@item gnustep-make
@item gnustep-base
@item gnustep-gui
@item gnustep-back
@end itemize

See @url{http://www.gnustep.org/} for further information.

To build Gorm, you must first install GormLib.  GormLib is a subproject of
Gorm.  Once GormLib is built, install it and then build Gorm.  Steps to build:

@itemize
@item cd GormLib
@item make && make install 
@item cd .. (to the Gorm directory)
@item make && make install
@end itemize
