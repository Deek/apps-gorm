applications) for a GNUstep application.

Notes on implementation

The IB documentation on how object selection is managed and how editors and
inspectors are used is unclear ... so I've gone my own way.

1. When a document is loaded, the document object creates an editor attached
to each top-level object in the user interface (NSMenu and NSWindow objects).

These editors must be aware of their edited objects being clicked upon, and
clicking on one of these should cause the corresponding editor to become the
active editor.

The active editor is responsible for handling selection of the edited object
(and any objects below it in the object hierarchy).  Upon change of selection,
the editor is responsible for sending an IBSelectionChangedNotification with
the selection owner (normally the editor itsself) as the notification owner.

The main application watches for these notifications in order to keep track
of who has the selection.



Connections

The connection API is the same as that for IB, but with the extension that the
document object must implement [-windowAndRect:forObject:] to return the
window in which the object is being displayed, and the rectangle enclosing
the object (in window base coordinates).

This information is neede by Gorm so that it can mark the connection.

The editors mananging the drag-and-drop operation for a connection must call
[NSApp -displayConnectionBetween:and:] to tell Gorm to update its display.
This method sets the values currently returned by
[BSApp -connectSource] and [NSApp -connectDestination]
