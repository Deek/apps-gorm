@chapter Overview

Gorm is an application for creating the user interface (and possibly entire
applications) for a GNUstep application.  Initially a close clone of the old
NeXTstep 3.3 Interface Builder application, I expect that Gorm will mutate
beyond the capabilities of that app.

GNUstep is an object-oriented programming framework and a collection of tools
developed for or using the GNUstep libraries.

You can find out more about GNUstep at
@url{http://www.gnustep.org}@*

The basic idea behind Gorm is simple - it provides a graphical user interface
with which to connect together objects from the GNUstep libraries (as well as
custom-written objects) and set their attributes in an easy to use manner.

The collection of objects is then saved as a document which can either be
re-loaded into Gorm for further editing, or can be loaded into a running
GNUstep application in order to provide that application with a user
interface or some subsystem.

Notes on implementation

The IB documentation on how object selection is managed and how editors and
inspectors are used is unclear ... so I've gone my own way.

1. When a document is loaded, the document object creates an editor attached
to each top-level object in the user interface (NSMenu and NSWindow objects).

These editors must be aware of their edited objects being clicked upon, and
clicking on one of these should cause the corresponding editor to become the
active editor.

The active editor is responsible for handling selection of the edited object
(and any objects below it in the object hierarchy).  Upon change of selection,
the editor is responsible for sending an IBSelectionChangedNotification with
the selection owner (normally the editor itsself) as the notification owner.

The main application watches for these notifications in order to keep track
of who has the selection.



Connections

The connection API is the same as that for IB, but with the extension that the
document object must implement [-windowAndRect:forObject:] to return the
window in which the object is being displayed, and the rectangle enclosing
the object (in window base coordinates).

This information is needed by Gorm so that it can mark the connection.

The editors mananging the drag-and-drop operation for a connection must call
[NSApp -displayConnectionBetween:and:] to tell Gorm to update its display.
This method sets the values currently returned by
[BSApp -connectSource] and [NSApp -connectDestination]

@cindex defaults

Currently (Jan 4 2000) there is no preferences panel.
Application defaults are stored in the file `Defaults.plist', so this file
determines the default values if they are not overridden.

The current defaults are -

@itemize @bullet
@item SaveAsNib

If this boolean is set to @samp{YES} then Gorm will save documents with a
@samp{.nib} file extension (for NeXT/Apple compatibility), otherwise it will
save with a @samp{.gorm} extension.  In either case, Gorm will permit attempts
to open either type of document.

NB. While Gorm will attempt to open @samp{.nib} documents, it can't open true
NeXT/Apple documents, only ones it has written itsself.
