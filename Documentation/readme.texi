Please note - to build this code you will need the latest library source
from the CVS repository, and it may be that you also need to be using the
xgps backend rather than xdps (I don't have xdps running to test it on).


Gorm is an acronym for Graphic Object Relationship modeler (or perhaps
GNUstep Object Relationship Modeler).

Gorm is a clone of the NeXTstep `Interface Builder' application for GNUstep.

Gorm is not `gormless' (a Yorkshire dialect word that my parents used when they
spotted me staring, slack-jawed, at the TV).

Gorm is part of the GNUstep project, and is copyrighted by the Free Software
Foundation.

Gorm is released under the GPL - see the file `COPYING' for details.
